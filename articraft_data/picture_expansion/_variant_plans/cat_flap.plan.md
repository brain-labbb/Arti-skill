# Variant Plan — Pet_Animal related / Cat flap (`cat_flap`)

pattern: **mixed** (single `panel_frame` host root carrying one top-hinge revolute `flap`; add-on modules = tunnel liner / sliding lock / electronic housing; flap-count multiplicity)
richness band: **simple** (8–12 candidate anchors) — cat flap is a low-vocabulary object.
parents (both origins, fully accounted):
- P002 `rec_pet_animal_related__cat_flap__002_png_ce5bd540abfd475c80de66a1475b90ac` — pic `picture/Pet_Animal related/Cat flap/002.png` — white flap in a glass patio door; rounded-rect trim, short tunnel sleeve (tunnel_side/top/sill), 6 screws, smoky swing flap, magnet catch. cadquery `_rounded_ring`/`_rounded_panel` helpers.
- P001 `rec_pet_animal_related__cat_flap__001_png_bc9eca847b4f4feba5eab6c1d837b845` — pic `picture/Pet_Animal related/Cat flap/001.png` — flap in a wooden door; `BezelGeometry` rounded-rect front_trim + inner_seal, 4 screws, frosted swing flap, magnet catch.

Both origins demonstrate the SAME structural configuration: door-mount thin panel, rounded-rect opening, single rigid **top-hinge swing flap (revolute `frame_to_flap`)**, manual bottom **magnet latch**. They differ only in host (glass vs wood), trim helper, screw count (④/⑤/⑥ + host), not in structure.

## subcategory_contract
```yaml
subcategory_contract:
  category: Pet_Animal related
  subcategory: Cat flap
  core_identity: A framed pet-sized opening mounted in a host panel/door/wall, closed by a movable flap the animal pushes through.
  must_keep:
    - a real through-opening sized for a cat, framed by a trim/bezel
    - at least one movable closure (swing flap on a top hinge) with a real non-fixed joint
    - mounting context (door panel, wall, or tunnel) that carries the frame
  must_not_become:
    - window / porthole / vent / air duct (no pet passage)
    - mail slot / letterbox
    - cabinet door / plain hinged panel with no framed pet opening
    - doorbell / intercom / security camera / smart-lock panel
  image_evidence:
    - rectangular white/dark bezel with rounded corners set into a door or glass (002, 001)
    - single translucent flap hanging in the opening, hinged at the top, swinging out as the cat passes (both)
    - screw heads at the trim corners; magnet catch at the flap bottom
    - 001 shows a wooden-door mount; 002 shows a glass-door mount with a short tunnel/sleeve
  parent_evidence:
    - parts: panel_frame (host + trim + seal + screws + hinge hardware + frame magnet), flap (panel + hinge barrel/sleeve + magnet keeper + lips/seals)
    - joint: frame_to_flap REVOLUTE about top X axis, limits ~±1.05 (002) / (-0.85,0.60) (001)
    - helpers: _rounded_ring/_rounded_panel (002), BezelGeometry + _flap_origin (001)
    - 002 already has a short tunnel: tunnel_side_0/1, tunnel_top, tunnel_sill
    - screw multiplicity loop: 6 (002) / 4 (001)

## Six-Axis Diversity Audit
| axis | treatment | values / range / reason |
|---|---|---|
| ① skeleton/topology | source-backed (origin + 3 forks) | door_mount panel (origin) / wall_tunnel liner + rear frame (fork) / electronic housing module (fork); flap-count topology via double-flap (fork) |
| ② joint/mechanism | source-backed (origin + 1 fork) | top-hinge REVOLUTE swing flap (origin, both) + added PRISMATIC 4-way lock slider (fork); microchip mode_button optional small control |
| ③ primary form family | source-backed (origin + 1 fork) | rounded-rectangular opening/flap (origin) vs circular disc opening/flap (fork) |
| ④ surface decoration | record_only / companion | screw heads + slots, gasket/seal strips, magnet strips, brand/LED decals (microchip); host texture (wood grain / glass); host-conformal only |
| ⑤ proportion / size / travel | record_only | opening ~0.23×0.30 (rect) / Ø~0.26 (round); flap swing limits ~-1.05..+1.05 (002) / -0.85..+0.60 (001); slider travel ~0.30; tunnel depth ~0.15–0.30 |
| ⑥ material / palette / finish | record_only | warm-white / charcoal / brushed-metal trim; frosted / smoky translucent flap; black rubber seal; masonry-grey liner (tunnel); no standalone variant |

## Multiplicity / Copy Logic
- **flap count (Slot D, structural):** count_param `n_flaps`; source-backed N samples {1 (P001,P002), 2 (fork rec_cat_flap_var_n2_dualflap)}; suggested N_range [1,2]; copied object = flap panel + hinge barrel + magnet keeper; placement = in series along tunnel depth (+Y); naming `flap` / `rear_flap` (indexed); joint policy = each flap keeps its own top-edge revolute hinge + magnet. Built with a shared flap-builder helper.
- **fasteners (Slot F, cosmetic multiplicity, no fork):** count_param `n_screws`; N samples {4 (P001), 6 (P002)} both origin-shown; N_range [4,8]; copied object = screw head + slot; placement = trim corners/edges (loop-emitted); joint policy = FIXED decorative. No fork emitted — both N already source-backed and screws are ④-class fasteners.
- **lock rails (probe-free):** guide_rail_0/1 loop-emitted in the slider fork, FIXED; not a standalone N axis.

---

## Budget Decision
- Candidate anchors (origins + converged forks; probes/baselines/④⑤⑥ not counted):
  - origin-backed: door_mount, rounded_rect, swing_flap_revolute, single_flap, manual_magnet, screws_N4, screws_N6 = **7**
  - fork-backed: wall_tunnel_liner (①), circular_disc (③), sliding_4way_lock (②), double_flap N=2 (N), electronic_microchip_housing (①) = **5**
  - **total ≈ 12 candidate anchors** → top of the **simple** band. Coverage-first, no padding.
- Fork jobs emitted: **5** (one per new candidate not already shown by an origin).
- underfilled_reason: none — every real functional slot reaches ≥2 structurally distinct source-backed candidates; further growth (e.g. roll-up closure, sliding-glass-track insert, N≥3 louvered flaps) would drift toward window/vent neighbors, so intentionally stopped at the simple-band top.

## Blocked / Excluded
- roll-up / flexible-curtain closure: thin real-world support; drifts toward vent-curtain — excluded to stay in simple band.
- sliding-glass-patio-door tall track insert: host-panel change, not a cat-flap structural axis — record_only host context, not forked.
- N≥3 flap/louver stack: would read as a louver/vent, not a pet door — blocked (must_not_become).
- screw N-sweep fork: both N=4 and N=6 already origin-shown and screws are ④-class fasteners — recorded, no fork.
