## Six-Axis Diversity Audit
| axis | treatment | values / range / reason |
|---|---|---|
| ① skeleton / topology | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | wheel-config 4-wheel(A) / 3-wheel(B); cabin-count single(A,B) / double-tier(fork). |
| ② joint / mechanism | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | canopy revolute + handle revolute + wheel continuous (both origins); rear-wheel Mimic (B); NEW: front swivel-caster revolute, front-door revolute flap, telescoping prismatic handle, reversible wide-arc handle revolute. |
| ③ primary form family | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | soft fabric sewn cabin (A,B) / rigid hard-shell carrier pod (fork) / fully enclosed mesh dome (fork). |
| ④ surface decoration | record_only / world_knowledge_extrapolation | perforated side/front mesh windows, stitched trim, badges/logo decal, cup-holder accessory, canopy mesh pattern. Not a standalone variant. |
| ⑤ proportion / size / travel | record_only | rear tire radius 0.145-0.19 vs front 0.096-0.13; canopy revolute ~[-0.2,1.05]; handle fold [0,0.95]; telescoping travel ~0.18 m (companion only). |
| ⑥ material / palette / finish | record_only / companion | champagne-gold frame + black fabric (A) vs navy fabric + black/silver + white rims (B); EVA solid vs pneumatic spoked tire; carrier pod rigid plastic palette (companion on rigid_carrier). |

## Multiplicity / Copy Logic
- **wheels**: count_param = ground-wheel count; N samples {3 (B), 4 (A)} — both origin-backed, no extra fork. copied_object = wheel part (`_add_wheel` tire+rim+hub) + its continuous `*_spin` joint; naming rear_wheel_{i}/front_wheel_{i}; placement = front axle pair + rear axle pair (or single front on fork); joint_policy = one continuous spin per wheel (B mirrors rear pair via Mimic). suggested N_range {3,4}.
- **cabin tiers**: count_param = cabin count; N samples {1 (A,B), 2 (fork skeleton_double_cabin)}; copied_object = fabric cabin box (floor+4 walls+mesh windows) via shared helper, indexed cabin_{idx}_*; placement = stacked along +Z with a shelf divider; joint_policy = both cabins FIXED to frame. N_range {1,2} (no >2 tiers).
- Repeated wheels/casters/cabins must be loop-emitted with shared helpers and stable indexed names (parents already do this for wheels).

## Compatibility Probes
None emitted. The only genuinely risky interface (rigid pod clamp vs frame) is already exercised by `form_rigid_carrier` on parent A; re-testing it on the jogger frame would be marginal, so no probe is added (coverage first, no padding).

## Blocked / Excluded
- reclining backrest mechanism: pet cabins are flat bassinets; a reclining seat-back reads as a baby/child stroller feature -> would drift toward the baby-stroller neighbor. Blocked.
- open-top flatbed / no-canopy pet wagon: drifts to the pet wagon / utility cart neighbor. Blocked.
- 6+ wheel / side-by-side twin-frame: not a real pet-stroller archetype; double-pet need already covered by stacked `skeleton_double_cabin`. Excluded.
- foot-brake pedal, cup-holder/tray accessory, tire tread/pneumatic-vs-EVA, fabric color: ④/⑤/⑥ only — recorded, not forked.

## underfilled_reason
Honest structural vocabulary for pet strollers converges at 9 candidate anchors (2 origins + 7 forks), the low end of the normal band. Every supported slot already has >=2 structurally distinct candidates; remaining variation is either ④/⑤/⑥ (tire type, fabric palette, mesh pattern, accessories) or drifts into neighbor subcategories (recline -> baby stroller, open flatbed -> pet wagon). No filler variants added.
