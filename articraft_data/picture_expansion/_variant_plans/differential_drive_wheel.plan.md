# Variant Plan — Robotics / Differential drive wheel

slug: `differential_drive_wheel`
pattern: **mixed** (parallel children: two coaxial driven wheels + a drive/reduction mechanism hung on a chassis-mount carrier; one origin adds a top swivel link in the chain; gear-train and fastener multiplicity)
richness band: **simple** (8–12) — coverage-first; two genuinely distinct real archetypes but a moderate structural vocabulary
candidate anchors total: **11** (2 origins + 9 forks)
fork jobs emitted: **9**

## Slot / Candidate Grid
| slot | candidates (source) | axis |
|---|---|---|
| **drive_mechanism** | bevel_differential(A), dual_motor_gearbox(B), belt_reduction(fork belt), worm_reduction(fork worm), hub_direct_drive(fork hubdrive) | ② |
| **carrier / body form** | open_exposed(A), enclosed_plate_gearbox(B), enclosed_diff_housing(fork enclosed_housing), minimal_hub_bar(fork hubdrive) | ③ |
| **steering_swivel** | rigid_none(A), limited_swivel(B), continuous_caster_slew(fork caster) | ② |
| **mount_interface (support_or_base)** | rear_bridge_plate(A), top_mount_plate(B), vertical_side_flange(fork sideflange) | ③/interface |
| **suspension / skeleton** | rigid_axle(A,B), sprung_rocker_arm(fork suspension) | ① |
| **differential_multiplicity** | simplified_single_side_gear(A baseline), spider_2_pinion(fork spider_n2), spider_4_pinion(fork spider_n4) | N |

Every supported slot reaches ≥2 structurally distinct candidates.

## Mandatory 6-Axis Diversity Audit
| axis | treatment | values / reason |
|---|---|---|
| ① skeleton / topology | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | rigid_axle(A,B) vs sprung_rocker_arm (fork suspension adds rocker link + spring joints); B also adds the plate→swivel→carriage chain |
| ② joint / mechanism | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | bevel-diff mimic train(A); dual-motor + limited swivel(B); belt, worm, hub-direct reductions (forks); continuous caster slew swivel (fork) |
| ③ primary form family | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | open_exposed(A) / enclosed_plate(B) / enclosed cast diff housing (fork) / minimal hub bar (fork) / vertical side-flange mount (fork) |
| ④ surface decoration | record_only / companion | bolt circles, lift eyes, cooling fins, hub screws, gearbox side screws, tread patterns; host-conformal only — no standalone variant |
| ⑤ proportion / size / travel | record_only | wheel Ø ~0.26–0.27; swivel limited ±0.35 vs continuous; gear ratios (input→ring −0.42, side −1.0); tire width ~0.073–0.083; ride only as companion |
| ⑥ material / palette | record_only | tan polyurethane / black rubber tire; brushed-aluminum vs gunmetal carrier; blue motor; anodized colored gears (orange/brass/yellow); never a standalone variant |

## Multiplicity / Copy Logic
- **primary N axis — differential planet/spider pinions**: `count_param n_planet_pinions`; source-backed N samples {2, 4} (forks spider_n2, spider_n4); suggested N_range [2,4]; copied_object `planet_pinion_{i}` via shared `_toothed_bevel_mesh`, radial placement (180° / 90°), uniform mimic joint policy tied to `orange_gear_spin`. Baseline A carries a degenerate single side gear, so both N samples are forked.
- **wheels**: fixed at N=2 (definitional for differential drive — not swept). Each wheel is an independent continuous child; loop-emitted in B (`for i, pos in wheel_positions`).
- **fastener / fin copy logic (record_only, not candidate anchors)**: B loop-emits `plate_screw_i`(8), `bearing_screw_i`(10), `hub_screw_j`(10), `motor_fin_i`(3), `gearbox_screw_{side}_{j}`; A uses `BoltPattern(count=5)` on the rim + `cap_bolt` pairs. These expose copy logic for template sampling but are parametric, not forked.

## Budget Decision
Simple band, 11 candidate anchors (2 origins + 9 forks). Coverage-first: each real slot has ≥2 structurally distinct candidates; mechanism slot is deliberately the richest (5) because the subcategory spans both the mechanical-differential and independent-dual-motor interpretations of "differential drive". No ④/⑤/⑥-only, scale-only, or material-only variants were added. Not padded to the normal band; the honest structural vocabulary tops out around here.
`underfilled_reason` (N samples): the differential spider realistically supports only 2 or 4 planet pinions, so the N axis is covered with 2 samples rather than 3.

## Blocked / Excluded
- wheel-count N-sweep (3/4 wheels): blocked — differential drive is definitionally 2 coaxial wheels; more wheels drift toward a full chassis/rover (out of subcategory).
- chain_drive: excluded — redundant mechanism family with belt_reduction; belt already exposes the flexible-drive template.
- tread/color/tire-material only variants: excluded — ④/⑥ record_only, never standalone anchors.
- compatibility probes: none emitted — no genuinely risky interface combination beyond the single-axis forks above.
