# Variant Plan — Pet_Animal related / Animal feeding bowl stand

slug: `animal_feeding_bowl_stand`
pattern: **mixed** (linear-chain height column with side-by-side bowl multiplicity (A); central pedestal with radial leg/clip multiplicity (B))
richness band: **simple** (8–12 candidate anchors)
budget decision: **8 candidate anchors** (2 origins + 6 forks) at the LOW end; 1 compatibility_probe (not counted). Coverage-first, no padding.

## subcategory_contract
```yaml
subcategory_contract:
  category: Pet_Animal related
  subcategory: Animal feeding bowl stand
  core_identity: an elevated stand/frame that raises one or more open pet feeding bowls off the floor to a comfortable eating height
  must_keep:
    - one or more open feeding bowls held in a support ring / seat
    - a base that lifts the bowl(s) above the floor (legs / pedestal / raised frame)
    - at least one real non-fixed joint (height slide, bowl lift-out, tilt, or fold) unless static_only
  must_not_become:
    - low non-elevated twin-bowl mat / tray / placemat (not raised)
    - cage-/crate-mounted clamp-on bowl holder (mounts to an enclosure, not a floor stand)
    - camera/mic tripod, floor lamp, plant stand, cake stand (host must retain bowl + holder)
    - automatic/gravity food dispenser or fountain (no reservoir/pump mechanism)
  image_evidence:
    - "001: black powder-coated H-skid frame, square upright post, sliding collar with two circular holder rings, two stainless bowls side-by-side, thumb-screw clamp knob for height lock"
    - "002: graphite X cross-base with 4 splayed feet + central hub, telescoping round pedestal tube, single stainless bowl (blue enamel band + white panda/paw print) captured by 4 radial molded clips on a ribbed support ring"
  parent_evidence:
    - "A (001): base_frame (2 feet + crossbar + upright_post + 4 rubber pads); height_carriage (square collar + 2 torus holder rings + welded tabs + clamp_backbone); PRISMATIC base_to_carriage; 2 FIXED bowls (loop); 2 CONTINUOUS clamp knobs"
    - "B (002): base (4 radial capsule feet loop + toe pads + central_hub + hollow_pedestal_sleeve + 3 collars); bowl_holder (sliding_inner_post + top_socket + ribbed_support_ring + 4 radial brackets/clips loop); PRISMATIC height_slide; 1 FIXED bowl"

## Slot / Candidate grid
| slot | candidate | diversity_axis | source_type | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| base_skeleton (①) | H-skid twin-foot frame + square upright post | ① | origin_anchor | A `base_frame` |
| base_skeleton (①) | X cross-base, 4 radial legs + central pedestal | ① | origin_anchor | B `base` |

| base_skeleton (①) | fixed raised "diner" frame, bowls dropped into tabletop cutouts | ① | forked_anchor | fork@A `diner_platform` |
| height_mechanism (②) | PRISMATIC height slide (square post / telescoping tube) | ② | origin_anchor | A `base_to_carriage`, B `height_slide` |
| height_lock (②) | CONTINUOUS rotary thumb-screw clamp knob | ② | origin_anchor | A `carriage_to_knob_{0,1}` |
| bowl_motion (②) | REVOLUTE tilt of bowl holder (angled feeder) | ② | forked_anchor | fork@B `bowl_tilt` |

Every supported structural slot reaches ≥2 distinct candidates: base_skeleton 5, height/bowl mechanism ② 4, bowl_holder 2, bowl_multiplicity 3.

## Six-Axis Diversity Audit
| axis | candidate-anchor? | treatment | values |
|---|---|---|---|
| ① skeleton / topology | yes (source-backed) | origin_anchor + forked_anchor | H-skid frame (A) / X cross-pedestal (B) / tripod (fork) / disc pedestal (fork) / raised diner frame (fork) |
| ② joint / mechanism | yes (source-backed) | origin_anchor + forked_anchor | prismatic height slide (A,B) / continuous clamp-knob lock (A) / revolute bowl tilt (fork) / revolute fold legs (fork) / prismatic bowl lift-out (fork@diner) |
| ③ primary form family | yes (source-backed) | origin_anchor | column-on-frame chain (A, box/extrude) vs pedestal-column (B, cylinder/lathe); bowl = open lathe shell (both). No new ③ fork honest → covered by origins |
| ④ surface decoration | not standalone | record_only + world_knowledge_extrapolation | ribbed grip ring (B), lobed knurled clamp knobs (A), rolled rim (A), printed panda/paw marks (B); extrapolate bone/fish/brand emboss (host-conformal only) |
| ⑤ proportion / size / travel | not standalone | record_only | height travel A ≈ 0.19 m (−0.110…0.080), B ≈ 0.09 m (0…0.090); bowl Ø ≈ 0.19–0.30; base footprint span ≈ 0.5 (A) / 0.54 dia (B); tilt limit ~0–25° (fork); may ride as companion on structural forks |
| ⑥ material / palette / finish | not standalone | record_only | powder-coat hammertone black (A), black textured plastic (B), brushed/mirror stainless bowls, blue enamel band (B); palette black/graphite/white/chrome/copper; companion-only |

③: origins already expose the two body-form families (planar box-frame chain vs volumetric pedestal-column); no additional ③ candidate is honestly source-backable without drifting, so ③ is anchored by origins and not separately forked.

## Multiplicity / Copy Logic
- **count_param:** `n_bowls` — side-by-side seats on the H-frame carriage.
  - copied object: bowl (cup+rim+flat_bottom) + `bowl_holder_ring` (torus) + welded `tab` + supporting foot/rubber-pad set.
  - N samples: **1** (B, different base), **2** (A origin, loop), **3** (fork@A `bowls_n3`). suggested N_range **[1,4]**.
  - placement_rule: linear along x, even center-to-center spacing ≈ 0.30–0.34 m; base_crossbar widened per N.
  - naming: `bowl_{idx}`, `ring_{idx}`, `tab_{idx}`, joint `carriage_to_bowl_{idx}`.
  - joint_policy: each bowl FIXED to shared carriage (or short PRISMATIC lift-out in the diner fork); one shared PRISMATIC height slide raises all.
- **secondary loops (not a separate N-sweep):** B's radial feet (count=4) and capture clips (count=4) are loop-emitted; leg count is the ① base-skeleton axis (tripod=3, disc=0), so it is covered by skeleton forks, not a standalone N variant.

## Budget decision
Honest structural vocabulary yields **8 candidate anchors** (2 origins + 6 forks): 3 new ① skeletons, 2 new ② mechanisms, 1 new N sample. This is the LOW end of the simple band and is coverage-complete (every supported slot ≥2 candidates; ②/①/N all source-backed). No ④/⑤/⑥/scale/color padding added.
`underfilled_reason`: object is structurally shallow (base + adjustable holder + open bowl). Further ideas were pruned — see Blocked. One compatibility_probe added for a genuine tilt×N=2 interface risk (not counted toward budget).

## Blocked / Excluded
- **cage/crate-mounted clamp bowl holder** — neighbor subcategory (mounts to an enclosure, not a floor stand); listed in must_not_become.
- **automatic gravity feeder / water fountain** — out of category (adds reservoir/pump, not a stand).
- **N=4+ side-by-side bowls** — N∈{1,2,3} already exposes the copy logic; higher N is padding.
- **additional ③ body-form fork** — origins already cover the two honest form families (box-frame chain vs pedestal-column); no further ③ candidate without category drift.
- **pin-detent vs friction height lock as a standalone ②** — mechanically near-identical articulation to existing prismatic slide + clamp knob; folded into ⑤/record_only rather than a fork.
