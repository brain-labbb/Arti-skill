# Workspace / Paper shredder — variant plan

slug `paper_shredder` · pattern **mixed** (single cabinet/body root; prismatic pull-out bin + press-buttons + slide switch + 4 continuous casters; button multiplicity loop).

## subcategory_contract
```yaml
subcategory_contract:
  category: Workspace
  subcategory: Paper shredder
  core_identity: A powered cutting head with a feed slot mounted over a shred receptacle; paper enters the top slot and shreds collect in a bin below.
  must_keep: [top shredder head with feed slot + cutter throat, a shred receptacle/bin, at least one real access or control articulation]
  must_not_become: [filing cabinet, storage cabinet, kitchen trash can / open bin without cutter head, printer/scanner/copier, pasta roller / wringer / mangle]
  image_evidence:
    - Boxy black plastic cabinet, wider rounded shredder head overhanging the bin (001, 002).
    - Long narrow top feed slot with an icon/control strip and small buttons + slider (002); silver top plate + control cluster (001).
    - Pull-out front waste basket partially withdrawn, with a smoked viewing window and a front grip (both).
    - Loose shredded paper filling the basket (both); side smoked window on the shell (001).
    - Four swivel-style caster wheels at the base corners (both).
  parent_evidence:
    - Root part shell/body; PRISMATIC pull-out basket (shell_to_basket / body_to_basket).
    - Feed slot, control panel/recess, front badge, indicator dots as top surface features.
    - PRISMATIC push buttons (loop N=2 in 002, N=3 in 001) + PRISMATIC slide switch (control_switch / mode_switch).
    - 4 CONTINUOUS caster wheels (shell_to_caster_i / body_to_caster_wheel_i).
    - 002 exposes static cutter_roller_0/1 visuals under the throat; 001 adds a connected paper_fill mesh.

Every supported slot reaches ≥2 structurally distinct candidates.

## Six-Axis Diversity Audit
| axis | treatment | values / range |
|---|---|---|
| ① skeleton / topology | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | support base: 4-caster rolling vs fixed desktop feet; cabinet-drawer vs door vs lift-off-head access topology |
| ② joint / mechanism | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | prismatic drawer, prismatic buttons, prismatic slide switch, continuous casters (origins); + revolute door, revolute tilt head, revolute auto-feed lid, paired continuous cutter shafts (forks) |
| ③ primary form family | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | rectangular boxy volumetric cabinet (origins) vs cylindrical drum bin (fork) |
| ④ surface decoration | record_only / world_knowledge_extrapolation | badge/oval logo, icon strip + indicator dots, cross-cut vs strip-cut throat pattern, control-panel iconography, smoked side/front windows — host-conformal, no dedicated variant |
| ⑤ proportion / size / travel | record_only (companion only) | basket travel lower/upper ~[-0.07,0.13]; button press ~0.004; switch ~±0.011–0.022; caster continuous; head/drum footprint scale — may ride along on round_bin / desk_feet |
| ⑥ material / palette / finish | record_only (companion only) | matte/charcoal/gloss black plastic, brushed-silver top plate, smoked translucent window, black rubber casters/feet, pale indicator marks — never standalone |

## Multiplicity / Copy Logic
- count_param: number of top push buttons (`button_i`, prismatic `*_to_button_i`).
- N samples: N=2 (origin 002), N=3 (origin 001), N=5 (fork controls_n5).
- suggested N_range: [1, 6].
- copied object: single `button` part with a `button_cap` cylinder; naming `button_0..N`; placement linear even spacing along `control_panel` x; joint policy one prismatic press joint per button (axis -z, shared limits).
- casters are fixed at N=4 in both origins (no sweep); button count is the honest multiplicity axis.

## Budget decision
- Richness band: **simple (8–12)**. Candidate anchors total = **9** (2 origins + 7 forked_anchors).
- compatibility_probe (not counted): 1 (round bin + lift-off head).
- Coverage first, no padding: paper shredders have a moderate but bounded structural vocabulary; 9 honest anchors cover all supported slots ≥2. No ④/⑤/⑥-only variants emitted.

## Compatibility Probes
| probe | record_id | combined axes | risk tested |
|---|---|---|---|
| round bin + lift-off head | rec_paper_shredder_var_probe_round_liftoff | ③ cylindrical + ② lift-off head | curved rim ↔ head hinge/clamp seating; gap/collision at round seam |

## Blocked / Excluded
- caster N-sweep: excluded — both origins fixed at N=4; not a meaningful multiplicity range.
- strip-cut vs cross-cut throat, badge/logo, icon strip: ④ surface only — record_only, no dedicated variant.
- CD/credit-card secondary feed slot: thin/borderline second-slot multiplicity — excluded to avoid padding.
- wall-mount / under-desk chassis: unsupported by origins and drifts toward built-in furniture — not forked.
