## subcategory_contract
```yaml
subcategory_contract:
  category: Workspace
  subcategory: Hole punch
  core_identity: A hand tool that perforates sheets of paper by driving one or more punch pins straight through the paper into matching dies, actuated by a single hand squeeze/press DOF, producing round holes and collecting the chads.
  must_keep:
    - one or more punch pins aligned to matching die bores/anvils
    - a single press/squeeze articulation (revolute or prismatic) that drives the pins into the dies
    - an open paper throat/slot gap at rest that closes on actuation
    - a chad/confetti path or waste window
  must_not_become:
    - eyelet / grommet setter
    - stapler
    - pliers / wire cutter
    - paper trimmer / guillotine
    - drill / hole saw / bench press-drill
    - comb / spiral binding machine
  image_evidence:
    - 001: two handheld metal punches — a plier/scissor crossed-arm punch (central rivet, jaws + single die/pin) and a spring loop-handle one-hand squeeze punch with a knurled grip and a row of chad-drain holes
    - 002: blue desktop punch — flat rubber-footed base, rear-hinged top pressing lever, punch head pressing down into die(s) in the base
  parent_evidence:
    - A (plier): parts `frame` (fixed arm) + `punch_lever` (moving arm) crossing at `rivet_shaft`; revolute `punch_stroke` (axis Y) drops `punch_pin` into `die_block` bore; single hole; `_bar`/`_boss`/`_grip_solid` helpers; knurled grips
    - B (desktop): `base` (rubber_pad, blue shell, die_ring/die_hole/die_boss ×2, paper_throat_gap, rear_hinge_block, hinge_barrel) + `pressing_lever` hinged by revolute `lever_pivot` at rear; two `punch_pin_{i}` FIXED to lever via `lever_to_pin_{i}`; loop-based pin/die emission (N=2)

Every supported slot reaches ≥2 structurally distinct candidates: skeleton ×4, mechanism ×2 (revolute/prismatic), N ×4 {1,2,3,4}.

## Six-Axis Diversity Audit
| axis | treatment | values / reason |
|---|---|---|
| ① skeleton / topology | candidate-anchor (source-backed) | plier-scissor (A), desktop base+rear-lever (B), sprung-loop (fork@A), compound lever+plunger-carriage (fork@B) |
| ② joint / mechanism | candidate-anchor (source-backed) | revolute pivot (A `punch_stroke`, B `lever_pivot`); prismatic plunger (fork@B); compound revolute+prismatic (lever-carriage fork) |
| ③ primary form family | source-backed via ①; not a separate fork | handheld frame vs desktop slab body are carried by the skeleton forks; no independent ③ vocabulary exists that isn't already a skeleton or ④/⑤ delta |
| ④ surface decoration | record_only / world_knowledge_extrapolation | die-hole shape (round vs shaped ticket-punch die), knurled grip pattern, chad-drain hole rows, blue highlight/shadow channels, screw heads — companion only |
| ⑤ proportion / size / travel | record_only | throat depth (short handheld ~26 mm reach vs long-reach), lever length, pin Ø ~2.8–3.6 mm, stroke ~0.14 rad / plunger travel; may ride as companion |
| ⑥ material / palette / finish | record_only | polished chrome / nickel (A, 001 right), blue painted metal (B), black rubber pad/foot, brushed steel dies — companion only |

## Multiplicity / Copy Logic
- count_param: number of punch-pin + matching die (`die_ring`/`die_hole`/`die_boss`) pairs, driven by the parent `for index, y in enumerate(...)` pin loop and paired die emission in `base`.
- N samples (source-backed): N=1 (A), N=2 (B origin), N=3 (fork@B), N=4 (fork@B).
- suggested N_range: [1, 4] (real office standards 1/2/3/4 hole; not beyond 4 for hand punches).
- copied object: `punch_pin_{i}` (pin + top cap + cutting tip) FIXED to lever via `lever_to_pin_{i}`, plus matching `die_ring_{i}`/`die_hole_{i}`/`die_boss_{i}` in base.
- placement: linear row along Y, equal spacing at realistic hole standards; N=4 widens base+lever along Y.
- joint policy: one FIXED `lever_to_pin_{i}` per pin under a single shared revolute `lever_pivot`; multiplicity forks change only count/spacing, not skeleton/mechanism.

## Budget decision
Simple band (8–12). Honest counted anchors = 7, just below the floor.
underfilled_reason: A hole punch is a single-DOF squeeze/press tool with limited structural vocabulary. The complete honest structural space is 4 skeletons (plier-scissor, desktop rear-lever, sprung-loop, compound lever+carriage), 2 mechanisms (revolute vs prismatic plunger), and an N-sweep {1,2,3,4}. Reaching 8+ would require padding with ④ die-shape / ⑤ throat-length / ⑥ palette variants, which the rules forbid as standalone anchors. One compatibility_probe (adjustable sliding heads on a rail) is added for the genuinely risky N-plus-rail interface but is not counted toward the budget.

## Blocked / Excluded
- screw-press / rotary-drive punch (② screw mechanism, scrapbook screw punch / paper drill): not cleanly representable as a single URDF joint (helical drive) and drifts toward the drill/press-drill neighbor — blocked/gated.
- ticket / shaped-hole conductor punch: die-hole shape is ④ surface decoration, not a structural anchor — record_only.
- long-reach / long-throat variants: ⑤ proportion only — record_only, not a standalone anchor.
- N>4 hand punches: not a real standard for hand punches; would be padding — excluded.
