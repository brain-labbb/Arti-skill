# Variant Plan — Robotics / Soft pneumatic gripper (`soft_pneumatic_gripper`)

pattern: **multiplicity + mixed** (rigid pneumatic manifold/mounting root carries N radial or opposing soft bellows fingers as independent REVOLUTE-bend children; per-finger hose-swivel sub-joint; finger/hose/yoke/air-tube loop multiplicity). Origins differ in finger count (2 vs 4), arrangement (opposing linear vs radial cross-rail), and bellow form family.

richness band: **simple (upper end)** — target ~8–10 counted candidate anchors. Honest structural vocabulary is moderate: a soft pneumatic gripper is always a rigid manifold + compliant pressurized bellows fingers that bend inward, so ①/②/③ vocabulary is real but bounded. Coverage-first, no padding.

## 1. Subcategory Contract
```yaml
subcategory_contract:
  category: Robotics
  subcategory: Soft pneumatic gripper
  core_identity: An end-effector whose grasping members are soft, compliant, air-pressurized silicone bellows/actuator fingers mounted to a rigid pneumatic manifold/mounting plate; the fingers bend inward under pneumatic pressure to enclose and grasp fragile or irregular objects.
  must_keep:
    - two or more compliant soft bellows/silicone actuator fingers (not rigid links)
    - a rigid central pneumatic manifold / mounting plate carrying the fingers and routing air
    - visible air routing (hoses, barbed fittings, elbows) feeding the fingers
    - at least one real non-fixed inward-bending articulation per finger (REVOLUTE bend approximating soft curl)
  must_not_become:
    - rigid parallel-jaw / two-finger pneumatic gripper (rigid jaws)
    - vacuum / suction-cup gripper
    - rigid multi-link tendon-driven robot hand
    - granular jamming (universal) gripper
  image_evidence:
    - "001.png: 4 cyan corrugated silicone bellows fingers hanging radially from a drilled round top plate over crossed slotted aluminum rails; central boss; pale pneumatic elbows and hoses beside each finger; fingers point down and curl inward"
    - "002.png: 2 opposing matte-black ribbed-fin silicone bellows jaws under a cross-shaped drilled aluminum plate + machined actuator blocks with clevis cheeks; central barbed fitting + air tube; laser-etched load labels (e.g. Max 1700g); two-jaw opposing grasp"
  parent_evidence:
    - "A (001, radial): manifold(mounting_plate perforated, central_boss, air_manifold_block, rail_x/rail_y crossed slotted rails, standoff_{i}/cap_screw_{i}, per-station yoke_cheek/yoke_bridge/hinge_pin/fixed_elbow/air_tube) + 4x finger_{idx}(actuator_base, soft_neck, bellow=_finger_bellow_geometry stacked oval fins + tip pad, grip_valley_{j}) + 4x hose_connector_{idx}; joints manifold_to_finger_{idx} REVOLUTE bend (independent) + finger_to_connector_{idx} REVOLUTE swivel; radial loop yaw=2*pi*idx/4"
    - "B (002, opposing): manifold(_metal_manifold_shape aluminum frame: top plate, standoffs, actuator blocks, clevis cheeks; screw/hex/port/barb fittings, fixed_air_tube spline, swivel_socket) + finger_0/finger_1(bellows=_finger_shape external ribbed fins) + hose_swivel(elbow_tube); joints finger_0_bend REVOLUTE + finger_1_bend REVOLUTE (mimic of finger_0) + hose_swivel REVOLUTE"
```

## 2. Slots and Candidates
| slot | candidate | axis | source | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| finger_multiplicity | N=2 opposing | N | B origin | origin_anchor |
| finger_multiplicity | N=4 radial | N | A origin | origin_anchor |
| finger_multiplicity | N=3 tripod radial | N | fork n3 | forked_anchor |
| finger_multiplicity | N=6 dense radial | N | fork n6 | forked_anchor |
| arrangement_skeleton | opposing linear two-jaw frame | ① | B origin | origin_anchor |
| arrangement_skeleton | radial crossed-rail | ① | A origin | origin_anchor |
| arrangement_skeleton | inline single-rail bank | ① | fork skeleton_inline | forked_anchor |
| bellow_form_family | stacked oval corrugated bellows | ③ | A origin | origin_anchor |
| bellow_form_family | external ribbed-fin (PneuNet) bellows | ③ | B origin | origin_anchor |
| bellow_form_family | smooth fiber-reinforced cylinder | ③ | fork form_fiber_cylinder | forked_anchor |
| actuation_mechanism | single inward REVOLUTE bend (+ hose swivel) | ② | A,B origin | origin_anchor |
| actuation_mechanism | PRISMATIC span-adjust carriage + bend | ② | fork mechanism_span_prismatic | forked_anchor |
| actuation_mechanism | serial multi-segment (2-knuckle) progressive curl | ② | fork mechanism_multisegment | forked_anchor |
| base_mount / support | drilled plate + crossed slotted rails | support | A origin | origin_anchor (record) |
| base_mount / support | machined clevis frame block | support | B origin | origin_anchor (record) |
| base_mount / support | round ISO-9409 wrist flange + bolt circle | ①/support | fork base_wrist_flange | forked_anchor |

Each supported structural slot reaches ≥2 distinct candidates. The base_mount slot is anchored by both origins (plate+rail vs clevis frame) and extended once (wrist flange) because it is a real topology change of the load-carrying root; mimic-coupled vs independent finger bend is recorded (B mimics, A independent), not forked.

## 3. Six-Axis Diversity Audit
| axis | treatment | values / reason |
|---|---|---|
| ① skeleton / topology | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | opposing linear two-jaw (B); radial crossed-rail (A); inline single-rail bank (skeleton_inline); round wrist-flange root (base_wrist_flange); serial 2-segment finger internal topology (mechanism_multisegment) |
| ② joint / mechanism | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | independent inward REVOLUTE bend (A); mimic-coupled REVOLUTE bend (B); per-finger REVOLUTE hose swivel (A,B); PRISMATIC span-adjust slide + bend (span_prismatic); serial REVOLUTE knuckle progressive curl (multisegment) |
| ③ primary form family | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | stacked oval corrugated bellows (A); external ribbed-fin PneuNet bellows (B); smooth fiber-reinforced cylinder (form_fiber_cylinder) |
| ④ surface decoration | record_only / world_knowledge_extrapolation | grip_valley insets, dark slot channels, drilled port holes / hex sockets, barbed fittings, laser-etched load labels ("Max 1700g" on B); rib-density and fiber-wrap pattern are host-conformal extrapolations, no dedicated variant |
| ⑤ proportion / size / travel | record_only | finger length ~0.09–0.14 m; bend upper 0.55–0.62 rad; hose swivel ±0.30–0.35 rad; span slide ~0–0.03 m; finger_radius ~0.10 m; rides along only as companion |
| ⑥ material / palette / finish | record_only | cyan/blue silicone (A), matte-black silicone (B); satin/brushed aluminum manifold, off-white nylon fittings, black air tube; extrapolate food-grade white / orange silicone; companion-only |

①②③ + N are the candidate-anchor axes and are all source-backed. ④⑤⑥ are record_only / companion — never standalone, never counted toward budget.

## 4. Multiplicity / Copy Logic
- **count_param (primary):** `n_fingers` — the radial/inline finger-station loop `for idx, yaw in enumerate(...)`.
  - N samples: origin-shown {2 (B, opposing), 4 (A, radial)}; forked radial sweep {3 (n3), 6 (n6)}.
  - suggested N_range: [2, 6].
  - copied object: the whole finger station — `finger_{idx}` (+ `actuator_base`, `soft_neck`, `bellow`, `grip_valley_{j}`), its `hose_connector_{idx}`, and its manifold-side `yoke_cheek_{idx}_{n}` / `yoke_bridge_{idx}` / `hinge_pin_{idx}` / `fixed_elbow_{idx}` / `air_tube_{idx}`.
  - placement: radial even at yaw = 2*pi*idx/N on a fixed finger-circle radius (A family); linear opposing/inline for the two-jaw and bank families.
  - joint policy: one independent REVOLUTE `manifold_to_finger_{idx}` bend per finger about its tangential axis (optionally mimic-coupled to a master, as B does for finger_1).
- **other loops (record_only):** plate screws/standoffs/port holes, wrist-flange bolt circle (`flange_bolt_{i}`, FIXED), grip_valley insets per finger — loop-emitted, indexed, FIXED decoration; recorded, not swept.

## 5. Budget Decision
- Counted candidate anchors (origin_anchor + forked_anchor): **2 origins + 7 forks = 9**.
  - origins: A (N=4 radial, corrugated-oval, crossed-rail), B (N=2 opposing, ribbed-fin, clevis frame)
  - forks: n3, n6 (multiplicity N); skeleton_inline (①); form_fiber_cylinder (③); mechanism_span_prismatic, mechanism_multisegment (②); base_wrist_flange (①/support)
- Not counted: no compatibility probes needed (no genuinely risky cross-slot interface this pool requires).
- `underfilled_reason`: not underfilled — 9 counted anchors sit in the simple band. Structural vocabulary saturates here: a soft pneumatic gripper is always a rigid manifold + compliant pressurized bellows fingers, so beyond finger count, arrangement, actuator form family, actuation mechanism, and base mount the remaining diversity is proportion/palette/decoration (④⑤⑥), which is recorded rather than padded into filler anchors.

## 7. Blocked / Excluded
- Granular jamming / universal pouch gripper form: excluded — different subcategory (jamming gripper), category drift.
- Vacuum / suction-cup end-effector: excluded — not a soft pneumatic bellows gripper.
- Extra N samples beyond {2,3,4,6}: excluded — copy logic already exposed across four counts.
- Mimic-coupled vs independent finger bend: recorded (B mimics finger_1→finger_0, A independent), not a standalone fork.
- Tip pad shape, grip-valley density, load-label decals, silicone color: record_only (④/⑤/⑥), not forked.
