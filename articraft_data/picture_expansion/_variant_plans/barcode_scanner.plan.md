## 2. Slot / Candidate Grid

|---|---|---|---|---|
| body_form / skeleton | pistol_grip_handheld | ① | origin_anchor | A, B |
| body_form / skeleton | presentation_tower (upright neck + weighted base, hands-free) | ① | forked_anchor | var_skeleton_presentation (fork B) |
| body_form / skeleton | inline_wand (single straight barrel, nose window) | ① | forked_anchor | var_skeleton_wand (fork A) |
| body_form / skeleton | fixed_mount_box | ①(+②) | compatibility_probe | var_probe_fixedmount_tilt (fork A) |
| body_form / skeleton | wearable_ring (finger scanner) | ① | blocked | thin/borderline drift |
| support_or_base | grip_base_freestanding | ① | origin_anchor | A, B (flared grip base) |
| support_or_base | charging_cradle_dock (scanner seated in dock) | ① | forked_anchor | var_base_cradle (fork B) |
| support_or_base | weighted_stand_base | ① | forked_anchor | ridealong of presentation_tower |
| support_or_base | mount_foot_bracket | probe | compatibility_probe | ridealong of fixedmount probe |
| opening_or_motion / mechanism | squeeze_trigger_revolute | ② | origin_anchor | A (grip_to_trigger), B (trigger_pivot) |

| cable / interface | coiled_corded | ④/⑤ | record_only | A (cable_coil) |
| cable / interface | wireless_no_cable (+ USB dongle) | ④ | record_only | B |

Supported structural slots each reach ≥2 distinct candidates: body_form (3 anchored forms + probe), support_or_base (grip base / cradle / stand), mechanism (trigger revolute / button prismatic).

## 3. Six-Axis Diversity Audit
| axis | treatment | values / range / reason |
|---|---|---|
| ① skeleton / topology | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | pistol_grip(A,B); presentation_tower(fork); inline_wand(fork); charging_cradle support(fork); fixed_mount_box(probe) |
| ② joint / mechanism | source-backed (origin + forked_anchor) | squeeze_trigger REVOLUTE(A,B); top_scan_button PRISMATIC(fork); bracket_tilt REVOLUTE(probe) |
| ③ primary form family | source-backed | volumetric envelope head + grip loft (origins); tower/base envelope; straight-barrel envelope; box envelope — all covered by the ① skeleton forks, no separate ③-only fork needed |
| ④ surface decoration | record_only | scan window type: laser line (A) vs 2D area imager in bezel (B); spec label; illuminated ring; grip rubber inserts; "Do Not Stare Into Beam" print — host-conformal only |
| ⑤ proportion / size / travel | record_only | handheld ~0.20 m tall; trigger squeeze 0.22–0.30 rad; head tilt ~0.20–0.30 rad; button prismatic ~2–3 mm; no standalone scale fork |
| ⑥ material / palette / finish | record_only | black plastic + blue trigger (A); charcoal + orange rubber + blue ring (B); template palette: black, charcoal, safety-orange, retail white/gray — no standalone palette fork |

## 4. Multiplicity / Copy Logic
No strong repeated-homogeneous-part axis in this subcategory. The trigger, scan window, and scan button are singletons; buttons do not appear in a regular loop-copied cluster in either origin. `underfilled_reason` (multiplicity): barcode scanners expose no source-backed repeated-part family (no louvers/keys/ribs/shelves); a multi-key programming pad is thin and not shown by either origin, so no N samples are planned.

## 5. Budget Decision
- Band: **simple (8–12)**. Counted candidate anchors (origins + converged forks) = **6** (2 origins + 4 forked_anchor). Probes/④⑤⑥ not counted.
- `underfilled_reason`: A barcode scanner is a structurally simple handheld electronic tool. Honest structural vocabulary is limited to a few skeleton families (pistol-grip, presentation tower, inline wand) plus a dock/base support, one dominant mechanism (squeeze-trigger revolute), and one alternate control (top prismatic button). Fixed-mount and wearable-ring forms are borderline/risky and are captured as a `compatibility_probe` / `blocked` respectively rather than padded in. Padding via laser-vs-imager window (④), corded-vs-wireless interface (④), color (⑥) or size (⑤) is disallowed by §6–§8, so the pool sits just under the simple band's 8 by design (coverage first, no padding).

## 7. Blocked / Excluded
- `wearable_ring` (finger-worn scanner): borderline miniature form with thin structural vocabulary and real risk of drifting toward "wearable device"; excluded rather than forked.
- `bioptic_in_counter` grocery scanner: too large / built-in-fixture, out of the handheld/countertop scope of the origins.
- ④ laser-vs-imager, ④/⑤ corded-vs-wireless, ⑥ palette, ⑤ size: recorded only, never standalone variants.

## Emitted Jobs
5 fork jobs (4 counted forked_anchor + 1 compatibility_probe). Manifest: `/tmp/jobs/barcode_scanner.jobs.txt`. Axis files: `/tmp/axis/barcode_scanner_var_*.txt`.
