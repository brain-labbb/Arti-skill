# --- Known-failure baseline (diff-regression) --------------------------------
#
# `tests/known_failures.txt` lists test node ids that were already failing
# before the current change (one per line, `#` comments allowed). They are
# marked xfail (non-strict) so the suite goes green on pre-existing debt and
# ONLY NEW failures are attributed to the change under test. A baseline test
# that starts passing shows up as XPASS — prune it from the file to shrink the
# baseline. Do not add new entries to hide a failure your change introduced.
