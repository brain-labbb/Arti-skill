"""Caster trolley / wheeled service cart modular template.

NOTE on the slug: ``caster_trolley`` = a **wheeled service / utility cart**: a
horizontal load surface (flat deck / stacked open trays / wire-mesh shelf stack
/ straight-walled utility wire bin) carried on a wheeled chassis that rides on
**N swivel casters** and is pushed via a tubular handle / upright. NOT a drawn
wagon (no draft pole, no big fixed/steered front axle), NOT a tipping barrow (the
load surface does not tilt), NOT a 2-fixed-wheel hand truck, NOT a powered AGV.

Neighbor boundary: the chrome **tapered wire-basket supermarket shopping
trolley** (nesting splayed basket, fold-down child seat, low chrome push-bar,
chrome colorway) is OUT of scope -> split into its own 小类 ``Caster Trolley2``.
A straight-walled warehouse wire bin is in scope; the tapered nesting
supermarket basket is not.

The **defining articulation** (per the user's authoritative final decision) is an
ALL-RIGID caster layout: there are **NO swivel casters anywhere**. Every wheel
mount is RIGID — ``load_surface_to_caster_yoke_{i}`` is **FIXED** for all i (no
kingpin / swivel joint anywhere) — and each wheel simply **rolls CONTINUOUSLY
about its own transverse axle through the wheel center** (roll, CONTINUOUS +Y).
The roll joint is the category-identity motion and is present on every caster of
every seed. This joint config is UNIFORM across all casters and all seeds.

Wheel APPEARANCE varies via a per-seed ``wheel_style`` axis (``solid_rubber`` /
``poly_hard`` / ``pneumatic_tread`` / ``cast_spoked``): the wheel GEOMETRY and
material change with the style, but the joint stays fixed-mount + center-roll
regardless of type. ``deck_bottom_z`` is recomputed as ``2*wheel_r + clearance``
per style so the wheel always lands on the ground (bottom z≈0).

Sourced from the reviewed modular spec
``articraft_template_authoring/specs_modular_v1/Urban_Environment_Caster_Trolley.md`` and the
``Caster trolley`` 5-star pool (5 parents + converged fork variants).

Structure (pattern = ``mixed``): a single root **load_surface** part (Slot A)
holds the load-bearing shell; everything else parents directly to it as parallel
children:

  * Slot A ``load_surface`` (4): flat_platform_deck / stacked_open_trays /
    wire_mesh_shelf_stack / utility_wire_bin. The root part. Tray / shelf tiers
    attach as FIXED children; the utility_wire_bin lattice (floor / 4 vertical
    walls / rim) is inline on the tubular chassis root (Rule 1).
  * Slot B ``handle_upright`` (3 base + folding sub-axis): tall_inverted_U_one_end
    / handle_both_ends / full_cage_uprights, plus the fixed<->folding sub-axis
    realized as folding_handle. Mounts FIXED on the root top/back edge, except
    folding_handle (REVOLUTE -Y hinge at the root top).
  * Slot C caster ring (N in [3, 8]): the **primary multiplicity axis**, count =
    ``len(positions)``. Each caster = ``caster_yoke_{i}`` (ALL FIXED rigid
    down-bracket, no kingpin) + ``caster_wheel_{i}`` (roll CONTINUOUS +Y through
    the wheel center; geometry per ``wheel_style``). Encoded into the slot_choice
    tuple as ``("caster_count", f"n{N}")``. Wheel appearance is the separate
    ``("wheel_style", <style>)`` slot_choice axis.
  * Slot C tier ring (N in [2, 6], conditional): active only for
    wire_mesh_shelf_stack; each ``shelf_{si}`` FIXED. Encoded as
    ``("tier_count", f"t{N}")``.

Compatibility (spec §9 / compatibility matrix):
  * full_cage_uprights REQUIRES wire_mesh_shelf_stack (the frame posts ARE the
    upright); on deck/tray/utility_wire_bin it degrades to tall_inverted_U_one_end.
  * utility_wire_bin has a planar top rim -> compatible with tall_inverted_U_one_end
    / handle_both_ends / folding_handle (NOT full_cage: no shelf frame posts).
  * tier_count is active only for wire_mesh_shelf_stack; deck/tray/bin fix
    their internal tiers by module.

All wheel-roll / hinge fits are captured geometry, so those
joints omit ``MatingContract`` (grandfathered, mechanical pivots) and are
guarded by the flat 0.015 m articulation-origin baseline plus element-scoped
``allow_overlap`` (mirroring each source's run_tests block). Tubular handle /
post frames use cadquery-swept tube meshes, the utility_wire_bin lattice uses
``tube_from_spline_points`` grid-loop wire meshes, and wheels use WheelGeometry /
TireGeometry meshes (no Box/Cylinder downgrade, Rule 3).
