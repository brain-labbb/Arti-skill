"""Lightweight module/slot/assembler abstraction for modular procedural templates.

Modular templates compose articulated objects from **modules** — self-contained
sub-trees that expose well-defined **mating interfaces**. An **assembler**
picks one module per **slot** and chains them via `MatingContract` joints.

Anchor responsibility moves from "whole template matches PRIMARY_ANCHOR" to
**"each pair of mated interfaces is geometrically compatible"**. Each module
declares the face it exposes; two chained modules must agree on face geometry
+ face dimensions within their declared tolerances.

This file intentionally provides only the abstraction; module factories and
the slot graph for each slug live in the per-template module.
