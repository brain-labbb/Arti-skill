"""Folding / bi-fold / accordion (concertina) door — modular procedural template.

A folding door is a linear-chain concertina of N rigid hinged leaves. Each leaf
hinges on the vertical meeting edge of the previous leaf, with ALTERNATING ±Z
fold signs so the chain zig-zags (concertinas) when driven. The chain hangs from
a static root frame (header track + left/right jamb + floor track). Every leaf
carries a steel perimeter frame, an infill layer (glass / wood / louver / muntin),
hinge knuckles down a vertical edge, and (track-dependent) end hardware.

DRIVE COUPLING: the fold is a ONE-parameter motion per chain, exactly like the
physical door (the track + panels constrain all hinges together). The jamb
hinge is the driver (limit ``_fold_limit``, derived from the folded-stack
clearance geometry); every interior leaf-to-leaf hinge carries a
``Mimic(driver, multiplier=2.0)`` on the alternating ±Z axes so leaf world
angles alternate exactly ±q. This intentionally replaces the earlier N
independent hinges: independent joint combos reach unphysical poses where
non-adjacent leaves pass through each other (motion QC 穿模), while the coupled
trajectory is exactly the set of physical accordion poses. The N-revolute chain
topology, joint count, and every module/multiplicity axis are unchanged.

Sourced from the reviewed modular spec
``articraft_template_authoring/specs_modular_v1/Door_folding_Door_Door.md`` and its
``data/records/rec_folding_door_*`` 5-star pool (1 center-biparting parent +
9 slot-fork variants: n2/n6/n8 chains, frameless/solid/louvered/muntin infills,
perimeter/bottom-track suspensions), all synced under ``data/records/``.

Structure (pattern = ``mixed``): a single static root ``frame`` part (mesh chosen
by ``top_track``) + N ``leaf_{i}`` parts in a revolute hinge chain. Three named
module axes plus one multiplicity axis:

  * ``leaf_count`` (N in [2,100]): the multiplicity axis — N leaves emitted in a
    loop, each a part. N drives the chain length / joint count / part count and
    is the dominant topology axis. Encoded into slot_choices as ("leaf_count",
    f"n{N}"). Per-N weighted sampling (small N high-frequency, large N rare).
  * ``leaf_infill`` (5): framed_glass_midrail / frameless_full_glass /
    solid_panel / louvered_slats / muntin_grid_glass — the leaf-local fill layer.
    Swaps the leaf's part visual set; does not touch the hinge frame / topology.
  * ``folding_kinematics`` (2): single_direction_stack (one continuous chain
    stacking against the left jamb) vs center_biparting_bifold (two symmetric
    half-chains hinging the two jambs and biparting at center; even N only).
  * ``top_track`` (3): flush_header_pivot / perimeter_cased_U_channel /
    bottom_track_floor_guided — root mesh + per-leaf end hardware + hinge z_anchor.

3 HARD RULES honored:
  (1) Infill panes / knuckles / handle / pivot pins / rollers are all
      ``leaf.visual(...)`` (Rule 1: non-moving decoration is not a part).
  (2) Every non-FIXED joint is a captured-pin hinge (pin/knuckle through the
      shared meeting edge or jamb), which cannot be modeled as two axis-aligned
      faces in contact, so per AUTHORING.md §B they OMIT
      MatingContract (grandfathered) and are guarded by the flat
      articulation-origin baseline + element-scoped ``allow_overlap``.
  (3) The leaf frame / glass / wood panel are CadQuery meshes
      (``mesh_from_cadquery``); louvered slats use a rotated CadQuery plank;
      no Box/Cylinder downgrade of the sculpted source primitives.

Compatibility gating (resolve_config, spec §"compatibility matrix"):
  * center_biparting_bifold requires even N -> odd N is projected up to N+1.
  * frameless_full_glass ignores mid_rail_fraction (single full opening).
  * bottom_track_floor_guided shifts hinge z_anchor to the guide-rail top.
