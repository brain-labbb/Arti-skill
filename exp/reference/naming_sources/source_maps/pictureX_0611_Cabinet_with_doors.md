Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`.
Category identity: one grounded (or wall-hung) load-bearing carcass enclosing a storage
cavity whose PRIMARY articulation is one or more door leaves. Drawers are out of scope
(sibling subcategory), and an all-glass vitrine without a cabinet body is out of scope.

## Rejected

- tambour / roll-top and accordion (>2 leaf) fronts: no source record in this subcategory.
- vitrine-only all-glass box and any drawer front: excluded by the subcategory contract.
- separate `curved_slab` door candidate: the leaf curvature is a cross-slot derivation from
  `body_form=curved_bow_shell` (origin 001), not an independent front treatment. Keeping it as a
  door_kind candidate would duplicate `flush_slab` on a curved host and force an artificial
  compatibility gate.

## Multiplicity

- `door_count = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4`, applied to `door_kind`.
  N=1 `rec_cabinet_with_doors_var_single_door/rev_000001` model.py:L254-L285;
  N=2 origins 001/002/003; N=3 origin 004 (row of three);
  N=4 origin 005 (two tiers of two, model.py:L209-L340).
  Every leaf is an independent moving child with its own joint; the row/tier layout, cell pitch,
  leaf width, hinge line and interior swing limits derive from N and the opening width.
- `shelf_count = 1 | 2 | 3`, applied to `interior_fitment`.
  N=1 origin 002 (`interior_shelf`), N=2 origin 004 (`shelf_0`/`shelf_1` model.py:L310-L330),
  N=3 origin 003 (`shelf_{index}` loop model.py:L216-L235).
  Shelf pitch, span and depth derive from the cavity and from the mechanism's front intrusion.

## Parameters and derivations

- `carcass_width_m`, `carcass_depth_m`, `carcass_height_m` are template-level and metre-valued;
  the curved host derives its radius from width and keeps a circular footprint.
- `door_swing_rad` bounds the outward hinge travel; interior leaves in a row derive a reduced
  upper limit from their neighbour geometry instead of relying on an overlap allowance.
- `slide_travel_m` bounds bypass travel and is clamped by the real opening and leaf width.
- Support height, plinth depth and cleat height derive per support candidate; the cavity floor,
  shelf ladder and door row heights all derive from the resulting body bottom.

## Cross-slot host adaptation

- `curved_bow_shell` derives a flat chord front frame across its opening, so flat-front leaves,
  bypass tracks and fold hinges mount on a real planar jamb. A swinging leaf on this host keeps the
  source-001 curved slab profile struck from the same annulus; sliding and folding leaves use the
  chord frame.
- `tapered_box` derives its door opening from the narrowest (top) width so a leaf clears the
  leaning side panels through its full travel, and its track/fold hardware follows the same width.
- `wall_mount` removes the floor support but still derives a full cavity floor and cleat spacing
  from the carcass, so the door rows are unchanged.

## Category identity and motion

- Exactly one `carcass` part carrying the side/top/base/back structure and the support base.
- At least one leaf part per declared door, each a moving non-fixed child of the carcass.
- Swing leaves rotate about a vertical hinge line registered through `mate_axes`; bypass leaves
  translate along the opening; bifold pairs add a second leaf folding off the primary leading stile.
- Shelves are fused carcass geometry seated on a real supporting footprint inside the cavity.
