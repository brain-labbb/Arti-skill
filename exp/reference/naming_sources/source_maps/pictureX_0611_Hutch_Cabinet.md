Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/arti-template/data/records`.
Category identity: a two-tier dresser/hutch — a deeper lower base cabinet carrying a shallower
upper case under a crown, with storage in BOTH tiers. A single-tier cabinet or a bare open
shelf unit is out of scope.

## Rejected

- single-tier cabinets and bare shelf units: excluded by the subcategory contract.
- pull styles and timber colour: derived detail, not independent slots.

## Multiplicity

- `lower_unit_count = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4`, applied to `lower_front`.
  It is the number of independently articulated lower units — leaves for `double_doors`,
  trays for `drawer_bank`, cubby columns for `wine_cubby_grid`.
  N=2 origin 001 (paired lower doors, model.py:L235-L400);
  N=3 `rec_picturex0611_hutch_cabinet_fork_lower_drawer_bank_20260713/rev_000001`
  model.py:L235-L420; N=1 and N=4 use the same loop with the base opening resized.
  Base opening width, unit pitch, leaf/tray width and travel derive from N.
- `upper_shelf_count = 1 | 2 | 3`, applied to `back_treatment`, sets the fixed shelf ladder
  inside the upper case (open_upper_shelves fork, model.py:L116-L257).

## Parameters and derivations

- `carcass_width_m`, `base_depth_m`, `base_height_m`, `upper_height_m` are candidate-local to
  `crown_form`; the upper case derives a shallower depth from the base depth.
- The upper front mechanism derives its opening from the upper case and the lower front derives
  its opening from the base cabinet, so the two tiers never share geometry.

## Category identity and motion

- Exactly one `carcass` part carrying both tiers, the deck between them, the crown and the back.
- At least one moving `lower_unit` part in every combination; the upper front adds moving
  `upper_unit` parts except for the open-shelf candidate, which instead carries real fixed shelves.
- Hinged leaves rotate about a registered vertical axis; drop and lift flaps about a horizontal
  axis; tambour and bypass leaves translate.
