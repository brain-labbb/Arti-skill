Excludes stacks or nests of several baskets, wheeled/trolley baskets, side-opening gates or tilt panels, under-basket drawers, telescoping pull-up bars on posts sunk into the body, collapsible crates, and multi-tier carry caddies.

| rec_a-rectangular-red-plastic-shopping-basket-with-r_20260608_160213_314844_c383d977/rev_000001 | reviewed | used | Red rectangular parent. Owns the rectangular tapered tub and the fixed central arched bail; the baseline every fork was cut from. |
| rec_a-rectangular-blue-plastic-hand-held-shopping-ba_20260608_160205_213315_254643d5/rev_000001 | reviewed | used | Blue rectangular parent, same baseline cell as c383d977 but with a dedicated `_cut_slots` helper; adopted as the slotted/perforated wall source. |
| rec_plastic-shopping-basket-with-perforated-slotted-_20260605_133637_322465_b050efd5/rev_000001 | reviewed | used | Third parent. Its walls are `SlotPatternPanelGeometry` panels with HORIZONTAL slot rows on a brick pitch (slot 70x8 mm, pitch 90x20 mm, optional stagger) -- a different perforation family from the vertical slot columns of 254643d5, so it owns its own wall candidate. |
| rec_change-the-overall-shape-to-a-rounded-oval-deep-_20260609_052813_481554_2ec27abe/rev_000001 | reviewed | used | Rounded oval deep body: elliptical loft (`_tapered_oval`/`_ellipse_at_z`) with matching oval rim and slots. Distinct footprint family. |

| rec_redesign-as-a-tapered-stackable-nesting-shopping_20260609_054812_490053_6a8aa2c9/rev_000001 | reviewed | used | Strongly tapered tub with a markedly narrower base than mouth. Distinct footprint family (the shape reads as stackable; the template builds one basket, not a stack). |
| rec_change-the-proportions-to-a-shallow-wide-tray-li_20260609_052818_608677_b5cd2054/rev_000001 | reviewed | used | Shallow wide tray proportions (low H, wide X). Distinct footprint family. |

| rec_change-the-handle-structure-replace-the-single-f_20260609_052816_880253_08aedfc5/rev_000001 | reviewed | rejected_duplicate | Dual independent handles; topologically identical to the two folding bails already adopted from 35468439. |
| rec_replace-the-two-folding-carry-handles-with-a-sin_20260609_065759_301946_09d0f958/rev_000001 | reviewed | rejected_category_drift | U-shaped telescoping pull-up bar on two posts that sink into the basket body. That is trolley/luggage hardware, not a hand-carried basket handle; it also reads as the wrong small-category in review. |
| rec_add-a-hinged-top-lid-to-make-the-basket-articula_20260609_062924_147603_ab5a00e2/rev_000001 | reviewed | used | Hinged top lid: single panel REVOLUTE about the +Y long rim, closed at q=0, ~115 deg open. |

On a round or oval plan that reads as a bin/hopper rather than a hand-held shopping basket; reviewer excluded it from the category scope. |
| rec_make-the-front-wall-a-low-hinged-panel-that-tilt_20260609_135307_236890_85ab5e66/rev_000001 | reviewed | rejected_category_drift | Tilt-down front panel: same wall-opening structure as 4598924c and excluded for the same reason -- a shopping basket does not have a hole cut in its side. |
| rec_make-it-a-two-compartment-divided-basket-add-a-f_20260609_054821_407943_31a4dbd5/rev_000001 | reviewed | used | Two-compartment basket with a fixed central divider wall fused into the tub. |

Reviewer excluded it from the category scope. |
| rec_restructure-the-parent-into-a-vertical-nesting-s_20260616_155259_758160_27719f51/rev_000001 | reviewed | rejected_category_drift | Vertical nesting stack of N tapered baskets (a qwen `neststack-n5par` family fork). A stack is several baskets rather than the one hand-held basket this category names; the stackable body shape itself is already covered by 6a8aa2c9. |
| rec_restructure-the-parent-into-a-vertical-nesting-s_20260616_153521_561026_465484ba/rev_000001 | reviewed | rejected_category_drift | Second vertical nesting stack (`neststack-n3`); same reason as 27719f51, and duplicate chain topology besides. |
