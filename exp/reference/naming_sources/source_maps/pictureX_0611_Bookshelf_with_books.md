# Bookshelf with books (desktop book tray / organiser) — SourceMap

export_category: pictureX_0611_Bookshelf_with_books

Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`.

Category identity: an injection-moulded **desktop file sorter** — a deck between two perforated
moulded end walls, split into upright bays by N movable divider plates. The source record states
the identity itself: the folder label is `Bookshelf_with_books`, but 001.png is a white translucent
moulded desktop file sorter (`classification_mismatch`, model.py:L106-L120), so the perforated end
walls and the tall sliding divider plates are the recognisable structure. The moving mechanism is
the divider set (sliding along the width, lifting out of sockets, or sliding bookends). It is not a
free-standing case: the `pictureX_0611_bookcase*` categories own those.

`core_domain = 5 (tray_body) x 3 (end_walls) x 3 (divider_mechanism) x 2 (base_style) = 90`;
`raw_domain = 90 x 4 (divider_count) = 360`.

Host adaptation instead of gates: every `tray_body` exports the same deck interface (deck plane,
usable half-width, book-bay depth and wall height); `end_walls`, `divider_mechanism` and
`base_style` consume only that interface. The incline rack exports a pitched deck plane, the
stepped tier its front tier, the ladder riser its lower deck, the cube grid its lower row and the
mesh basket its lattice wall line, so all 162 combinations build without a gate.

## Multiplicity and N derivation

- `divider_count = 2 | 3 | 5 | 7`, applied to `divider_mechanism`.
  - `observed_N = 3, 5` (bays_n3 / bays_n5) plus the solid-divider and books-row forks.
  - `derived_N_range = 2..7`: the divider loop is index-general (bay pitch derived from the usable
    width); the bound comes from the bay width a book row still needs and the pose budget.
  - validation: every N adds one divider part, one prismatic joint, one book group and one floor
    rail/socket, and re-derives the bay pitch, the divider travel and the book block sizes.

## Independent parameters (honest, not core/raw)

- `width_m` (0.28–0.55 m; source SORTER_WIDTH 0.340), `depth_m` (0.14–0.32 m; source 0.250),
  `wall_height_m` (0.13–0.26 m; source end wall ~0.220), `panel_thickness_m` (0.008–0.016 m;
  source WALL_THICKNESS 0.0055 / DIVIDER_THICKNESS 0.0040).

## Rejected

- Free-standing bookcase forks (upright_multishelf): they belong to the `bookcase*` categories.
- Books-only recolouring variants: surface-only, no structural candidate.
- `ladder_riser` (rear riser + upper shelf) and `tilt_back` (whole tray on a tilting cradle):
  both are real forks, but on a desktop file sorter they read as a different product; they are
  dropped so the category keeps the moulded-sorter silhouette. The contents stay sparse for the
  same reason — the authoritative image shows the sorter empty.
