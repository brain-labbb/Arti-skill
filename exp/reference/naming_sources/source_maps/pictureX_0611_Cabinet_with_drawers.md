Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`.
Category identity: a chest/dresser whose ONLY articulation is a set of pull-out drawers.
Every front opening is an independently sliding drawer; a swinging door leaf, a mixed
door+drawer sideboard, or open shelving is out of scope.

## Rejected

- separate pull styles as a slot: knob / handleless / turned wood / bail plate change only small
  surface hardware, so they are derived from `drawer_front` instead of forming an independent slot.
- swinging door leaves and door+drawer mixes: excluded by the subcategory contract.

## Multiplicity

- `drawer_count = 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6`, applied to `drawer_front`.
  N=2 `rec_cabinet_with_drawers_var_n2/rev_000001` model.py:L182-L260;
  N=3 origins 001/002/003; N=4 `rec_cabinet_with_drawers_var_n4/rev_000001` model.py:L166-L240
  and `rec_cabinet_with_drawers_var_grid2x2/rev_000001` model.py:L172-L250;
  N=5 origin 005; N=6 origin 004 (2x3 grid) and
  `rec_cabinet_with_drawers_var_n6/rev_000001` model.py:L208-L300.
  Every drawer is an independent hollow tray with its own prismatic slide and its own runner pair.
  Level pitch, front heights, runner heights, divider height and travel all derive from N and the
  layout candidate; the bottom level is graduated deeper exactly as in the origins.

## Parameters and derivations

- `carcass_width_m`, `carcass_depth_m`, `carcass_height_m` are candidate-local to `body_form`;
  the oval and bombe cases derive their plan profile from the same width/depth.
- `drawer_travel_ratio` bounds the slide as a fraction of the real box depth so the runner stays
  engaged with its rail at full extension.
- Front curvature is a cross-slot derivation: each drawer front is struck from the host's own plan
  profile over that drawer's x-range, so a bombe, bow or oval case gets curved fronts and a
  rectilinear or tapered case gets flat ones.

## Category identity and motion

- Exactly one `carcass` part carrying the shell, the support base, the runner rails and any divider.
- N `drawer` parts, each a hollow tray (bottom, two sides, rear wall, front) — never a solid block.
- One prismatic joint per drawer along -Y with lower=0 at closed and upper=travel at open.
- Runners sit on the drawer's left and right sides and stay engaged with the carcass rails through
  the full travel; no cross-drawer bar is used as a runner.
