## Semantic decisions

- Original 002's pedestal and original 003's long lower case are integral macro silhouettes. They
  remain coupled inside their respective body candidates, while their dial-axis and rear-plane
  interfaces are normalized so scale, winding, pointer and rear-support candidates can still vary.
- Numeral rendering is a sampled surface-detail parameter rather than a structural scale candidate:
  the robust block seven-segment style is retained alongside original 002's printed font outlines
  and original 003's slim instrument segments. It does not contribute to core/raw diversity.
- The timer always has a rotating dial and pointer. Those category-invariant mechanisms are assembly
  structure rather than diversity slots.
- There is no honest multiplicity axis in these sources. Repeated ticks, labels, feet, magnets and
  plug blades are fixed internal details, not template-level N.
- All accepted components can be sized from shared body/dial interfaces, so no compatibility gate is
  currently justified.
