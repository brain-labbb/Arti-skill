# Bookcase (free-standing shelved case) — SourceMap

export_category: pictureX_0611_bookcase

Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/arti-template/data/records`.

Category identity: a free-standing case built from vertical side supports carrying a stack of
horizontal book shelves, with at least one real non-fixed joint (a glazed/panel door, a drawer,
or a prismatic adjustable shelf). It is not a wardrobe, a sideboard, a nightstand, or a doored
display cabinet without shelving.

## Shared host preserved by every combination

> two vertical side panels + a top cap + a floor-standing base + N horizontal shelf boards
> spanning between the sides, with the front face open or closed by a moving front assembly.

Every source builds exactly this scaffold as one grounded `carcass` part and attaches its
moving children to it. The invariant kept across all form families is *vertical side supports
carrying a stack of book shelves*.

`core_domain = 8 (carcass_form) x 6 (front_treatment) x 2 (shelf_mechanism) x 3 (base_style) x 3
(back_panel) = 864`; `raw_domain = 864 x 4 (shelf_count) = 3456`.

Host adaptation instead of gates: every `carcass_form` derives the same front-aperture interface
(front plane y, aperture half-width, an upper band and a lower band in z) from its own geometry —
section frames for `barrister`, the front wing for `corner`, the raked front edge for `ladder`,
the widest bay for `grid_hutch`/`cube_grid`, the tier split for `two_tier_hutch`, the lifted floor
for `legged_highboy`. `front_treatment` consumes only that interface, so all 864 combinations
build and `TemplateDomain` needs no compatibility gate. The legacy template's `_gate_front`
front/form gate is therefore rejected.

## Multiplicity and N derivation

- `shelf_count = 2 | 3 | 5 | 8`, applied to `shelf_mechanism`.
  - `observed_N = 3, 5, 7` (the shelves_n* forks) with four-bay host-capacity evidence.
  - `derived_N_range = 2..8`: the shelf loop is index-general (pitch derived from the interior
    clear height), so the bound comes from host capacity — a shelf pitch must stay above the
    minimum book height — and from the compile/pose budget, not from the integers in the pool.
  - validation: every N adds one shelf board (or, for `adjustable_shelves`, one shelf part plus
    one prismatic joint) and re-derives shelf pitch, the interior clear height, the front
    aperture bands and the door/drawer heights.

## Independent parameters (honest, not core/raw)

- `width_m` (0.62–1.60 m; sources 0.70–1.55) — case width; derives side-panel spacing, shelf span,
  aperture half-width, door leaf width and drawer width.
- `depth_m` (0.26–0.58 m; sources 0.36–0.45) — case depth; derives shelf depth, drawer travel,
  runner length and door stand-off.
- `height_m` (1.20–2.30 m; sources 1.72–2.10) — case height; derives shelf pitch, aperture bands
  and base lift.
- `shelf_thickness_m` (0.018–0.032 m) — shelf board thickness; derives clear pitch and the
  adjustable-shelf travel window.

## Rejected

- Whole-carcass "wardrobe" and "sideboard" forks from the neighbouring 0611 categories: they
  drop the book-shelf stack, so they fall outside this category identity.
- Per-seed decorative-only variants (palette, grain strips, knob shape): surface-only, they do
  not contribute a structural candidate.

## Notes on quality preservation

- Doors keep their real stile/rail/glass construction (005 L46-L118) rather than becoming a slab.
- Drawers stay hollow trays: front + two sides + back + bottom (005 L171-L202), and slide along
  the real pull-out direction with the carcass providing side runners (005 L373-L381).
- The `legged_highboy` legs stay turned cylinders (004 L269-L340); the `ladder` stiles keep the
  raked loft profile; `corner` keeps the pentagon shelf plan.
- Hinges are built as real axis interfaces on the stile line, not as visual-only barrels.
