# piano_bench — SourceMap

export_category: piano_bench

Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/arti-template/data/records`.

SOURCES = 12: three origin anchors (`__001`, `__002`, `__003`) plus nine
single-axis fork variants. For the `piano_bench` category the recognizable
identity is a **wide two-person bench seat carried on a grounded frame with a
real height-adjustment mechanism**. Every origin anchor supplies that mechanism
directly: 001 a threaded side-knob spindle driving a guided storage carriage,
002 a side handwheel driving a paired lifting yoke, 003 twin lift posts inside
welded pedestal sleeves. Height adjustment is therefore the category's core
mechanism, not an optional feature, and it is modelled as a **mandatory slot**:
every candidate emits at least one rotary control plus the prismatic seat lift.
This is the direct fix for the defect that motivated the rebuild — the previous
template made the storage lid the only articulation source, so seeds that
sampled the no-lid candidate exported rigid bodies.

## Recorded, not promoted to candidates

| Source | Observation | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| rec_picturex_0611__piano_bench__001 (model.py:L26-L40 `_tapered_leg_shape`) | lofted tapered leg with chamfered foot | ⑤ proportion of the four-leg skeleton, not a separate topology → independent parameter `leg_taper_ratio` |
| rec_0611_piano_bench_var_seat_form_duet_rectangle (model.py:L214-L239) | wider duet seat on the same rectangular plan form | ⑤ proportion → independent parameter `seat_width_m`, not a candidate |
| rec_picturex_0611__piano_bench__001 (model.py:L49-L73 `_cushion_shape`, L346-L355 tuft buttons) | stitched channels + 4×3 button tufts | ④ surface decoration → seed-varied decoration on the cushion, contributes to neither core nor raw domain |
| rec_0611_piano_bench_var_footrest_folding_rail (model.py:L242-L266) | folding rail arm swapping the parent prismatic for a revolute | deferred: it changes the whole host lift topology rather than adding an independent component, so per the closed-combination rule it would have to become its own structural-family slot; recorded here so the decision is explicit rather than silent |

## Articulation invariant

Every reachable configuration carries **at least two movable joints**: one rotary
control from `height_mechanism` plus the `seat_lift` prismatic. `storage` adds a
third when `hinged_lid_box` is sampled. No candidate in any slot can produce a
rigid model, which is what preflight's `rigid_candidate_no_movable_joint` check
and the sweep/export `rigid_seed_no_movable_joint` gate now enforce mechanically.

## Combination notes (no compatibility gates)

- `round_stool` × `four_leg_apron` / `folding_x_frame`: the host derives a circular
  top frame ring from the seat radius instead of the rectangular ledge pair.
- `round_stool` × `hinged_lid_box`: the storage box and its lid are derived from the
  same seat plan profile, so a round seat yields a round box and a round lid.
- `twin_pedestal` × `side_handwheel_yoke` / `scissor_lift`: the pedestal columns
  derive an inner clearance well for the yoke/scissor sweep instead of the plain
  lift sleeve.
- `folding_x_frame` × any height mechanism: the X-frame emits a rigid top rail pair
  at the shared frame-top plane, so every mechanism mounts identically.
