# Pulley — SourceMap

export_category: pulley

The authoritative source pool is `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`.
One reference-backed original establishes the compact fixed-plate pulley; nine fork records
contribute explicit frame, mounting, secondary-eye, sheave-profile, and multiplicity evidence.
This map records semantic choices only and contains no copied source or dependency closure.

## Semantic decisions

- `frame_construction`, `mount_interface`, `sheave_profile`, and `secondary_module` are the four
  non-N slots. Their interfaces are simple enough that every cross-product combination can be
  supported through derived bridge, shell, cheek, latch, and becket geometry; no gate is used.
- `sheave_count` is the only multiplicity axis. N controls stack width, cheek centers, shell cavity,
  axle length, retainer positions, thrust washers, gate offset, and one indexed X-axis joint per wheel.
- The original fixed mounting plate is not fused permanently into every frame candidate. Its
  countersunk-hole language is retained by the `fixed_plate` mount candidate, while the frame owns
  the wheel chamber and bearing support.
- All wheel joints rotate through their bore center about X. The hinged cheek rotates about its rear
  Z-axis, and the swivel hook rotates about its captured vertical Z-axis. New-template axis mates
  are mandatory for each of these joints.
- Independent dimensions are limited to a conservative overall scale and sheave proportion family.
  Bore, axle, clearances, host capacity and opening dimensions are derived rather than sampled
  independently.
