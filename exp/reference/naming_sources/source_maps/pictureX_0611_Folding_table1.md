# Folding table 1 (tube-frame rolltop folding table) — SourceMap

export_category: pictureX_0611_Folding_table1

Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/arti-template/data/records`.

Category identity: a light tube-framed folding table whose deck is a rolled slat run, a solid
panel or an open mesh, carried by folding tube supports. Neighbouring categories:
`pictureX_0611_Folding_table` owns the general bi-fold/trestle family and
`pictureX_0611_Folding_table2` the caster / drop-leaf / compact family.

`core_domain = 4 (top_style) x 4 (support_style) x 3 (foot_style) = 48`;
`raw_domain = 48 x 3 (leg_count) = 144`.

Host adaptation instead of gates: every `top_style` exports the same under-deck interface (deck
plane, usable half-length and half-depth, one hinge line per station); `support_style` consumes
only that interface and reports its foot positions to `foot_style`, so all 48 combinations build.

## Multiplicity and N derivation

- `leg_count = 2 | 4 | 6`, applied to `support_style`; `derived_N_range = 2..6` from the deck
  length a station still needs and the pose budget. Every N re-derives the station pitch, the
  fold limit, the X-frame reach and the foot spacing.

## Independent parameters (honest, not core/raw)

- `top_length_m` (0.60–1.85 m), `top_depth_m` (0.42–0.86 m), `top_height_m` (0.32–0.78 m),
  `top_thickness_m` (0.018–0.040 m).

## Rejected

- Bi-fold split tops and A-frame trestles: they belong to `pictureX_0611_Folding_table`.
- Caster sleds and drop leaves: they belong to `pictureX_0611_Folding_table2`.
