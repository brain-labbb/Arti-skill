# Folding table (general folding table) — SourceMap

export_category: pictureX_0611_Folding_table

Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/arti-template/data/records`.

Category identity: a general folding table — a tabletop plus a collapsible support mechanism. It
is a table first: the articulation must be a foldable support or a folding top, not a fixed
workbench. Neighbouring categories: `pictureX_0611_Folding_table1` owns the tube-frame
rolltop/telescoping family and `pictureX_0611_Folding_table2` the caster / drop-leaf / compact
bi-fold family.

## Shared host preserved by every combination

> a rigid tabletop carried at working height by N folding support assemblies, each hinged under

`core_domain = 4 (top_style) x 7 (support_style) x 3 (foot_style) = 84`;
`raw_domain = 84 x 3 (leg_count) = 252`.

Host adaptation instead of gates: every `top_style` exports the same under-top interface (top
plane z, usable half-length, half-depth, and the hinge line for each support station); the
`support_style` candidates consume only that interface and the `foot_style` candidates only the
support's foot plane, so all 84 combinations build without a compatibility gate.

## Multiplicity and N derivation

- `leg_count = 2 | 4 | 6`, applied to `support_style`.
  - `observed_N = 4` (001 four folding legs), `2` (004 leg pairs) and `6` (the n6 fork).
  - `derived_N_range = 2..6`: the support loop is index-general (stations derived from the usable
    length); the bound comes from the top length a station still needs and from the pose budget.
  - validation: each N adds one support assembly (and, for telescoping legs, its prismatic inner
    section), and re-derives the station pitch, the brace geometry and the foot spacing.

## Independent parameters (honest, not core/raw)

- `top_length_m` (0.60–1.85 m), `top_depth_m` (0.42–0.86 m), `top_height_m` (0.32–0.78 m),
  `top_thickness_m` (0.018–0.040 m).

## Rejected

- Drafting/tilt tables, ironing boards and fixed workbenches: they are other categories.
- Rolltop slat and caster-sled forks: they belong to Folding_table1 / Folding_table2.
