# Flaring tool with cone and clamp — SourceMap

export_category: pictureX_0611_flaring_tool_with_cone_and_clamp

Records root: `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/arti-template/data/records`

SOURCES = 2. These two records are the entire structural-candidate pool. Each is a
plumbing/tubing flaring tool: a split clamp bar with a row of progressively sized
tube seats, a cast yoke that positions a feed screw over one seat, a rotary feed
screw that drives a conical die axially into the tube end, and a side yoke-lock
screw. The screw-fed cone (rotary drive + prismatic axial advance) and the split
clamp bar are the core mechanism and are shared by every candidate; slots are
declared only where the two records genuinely differ in part tree, joint, or
interface.

## Shared core mechanism (every candidate)

- clamp bar (root, role `clamp_bar`) with N progressively sized through seats, a per-seat
  counterbore, a hinge pin and two fixed knuckles — REC001 L31-48/L177-193, REC002 L57-93/L248-259.
- moving_jaw (role `moving_jaw`) with a barrel turning inside the fixed knuckles on a real
  running clearance — REC001 L51-75, REC002 L57-93 (three-knuckle hinge).
- feed_screw (role `feed_screw`): lathed ring-thread shaft, REVOLUTE about the true spindle
  Z axis at the yoke collar — REC001 L222-256/L333-342, REC002 L165-183/L328-345/L390-399.
- flaring_cone (role `flaring_cone`): conical die on a PRISMATIC -Z axial advance riding the
  SAME spindle axis down into the working seat; separate scalar joint `constrained_by` the
  feed turn — REC001 L124-135/L343-356, REC002 L186-199/L400-412.
- yoke_lock (role `yoke_lock`): side yoke-lock screw, REVOLUTE about Y — REC001 L280-313/L357-365,
  REC002 L296-326/L381-389.

## Multiplicity and derivations

- `tube_hole_count = 4 | 5 | 6 | 7`, item_slot = `end_clamp`. REC001 shows 5, REC002 shows 6.
  N sets the number of through seats, their counterbores, the N `<slot>__<candidate>__hole_size_marker_i`
  plates and the clamp-bar length. Seats are indexed about the working seat at x=0:
  seat i at x=(i - N//2)·pitch; diameters increase monotonically across the row.
- Independent params: `bar_pitch_m` (0.038–0.046; source ~0.040/0.042), `bar_width_m`
  (0.024–0.030; source 0.026/0.028), `bar_height_m` (0.018–0.030; source 0.028/0.018).
- Derived: end margin = 1.4·pitch; bar length; yoke travel = the seat row; yoke straddle span
  = bar_width − 0.003; leg foot z = bar_height − 0.0006; cone radius at the bar's top plane
  from the groove half width; every bore radius from the part it clears.

## Mechanism entities / axes / ranges / envelopes

- feed_screw_turn: REVOLUTE, axis Z on the spindle centreline at the yoke collar top;
  `mate_axes` + `register_interface_mate`. Range 0..8π.
- cone_feed: PRISMATIC, axis (0,0,-1) on the SAME spindle line, 0..0.017 (12 mm retract +
  5 mm penetration). The cone tip descends into the bar's flare groove with 1 mm floor
  clearance and >0.8 mm radial clearance, so full advance is real clearance, not masked overlap.
- yoke_mount sliding: PRISMATIC +X, travel = seat row. pivoting: REVOLUTE Z at the working
  seat, ±0.16 rad — that axis IS the spindle axis, so the cone never leaves the bore.
- jaw_pivot: REVOLUTE +Z at the hinge, 0..0.45. MEASURED: +q lifts the free end into +Y,
  away from the fixed half; −q would drive it through the fixed jaw.
- yoke_lock_turn: REVOLUTE Y (registered). clamp_rotation (screw_clamp only): REVOLUTE Z
  at the bar's end bore (registered).

## Per-element legit contacts (no allow_overlap anywhere)

- yoke legs seat on the bar's top face, 0.6 mm vertical lap, invariant for every yoke pose.
- fixed upper/lower knuckles lap the moving jaw's barrel by 0.6 mm in Z, concentric with the
  pivot, so the capture holds at every jaw angle.
- feed-screw thrust flange bears on the collar top, 0.6 mm in Z, spin invariant.
- four ball detents on the yoke's guide ribs graze the cone's shank by 0.6 mm across the WHOLE
  stroke (spheres: orientation-invariant AABB, wholly inside the cone's AABB).
- two ball detents on the lock stem graze the lock bore by 0.6 mm, spin and pivot invariant.
- clamp-screw flange bears on the bar's top face, 0.6 mm in Z, spin invariant.
- everything else is a real CAD clearance fit (knuckle bore > pin, yoke bore > cone envelope,
  collar bore > shaft, lock/clamp bore > stem): AABBs interpenetrate but fcl reports no contact.

## Deviations from the sources, and why

- Both source yokes straddle the bar in Y (REC001 legs at y=±0.042; REC002 cheeks at y=±0.033)
  and both sources hid the consequence behind `allow_overlap` / an unexercised jaw. With the
  hinge exercised to its limit the moving jaw sweeps a·tan(q) sideways at the yoke station
  (~63 mm at q=0.45, a=130 mm), so no Y cheek clearance is achievable at any credible bar
  width. The rebuild keeps both cast yoke silhouettes but bridges the working seat in X: the
  legs come down fore and aft of the seat and seat on the bar's top face. Clamp-open and yoke
  poses become genuinely independent, and the cone passes between the legs.
- The bar carries a continuous flare groove along the seat row (a real chamfered vee on this
  tool family). The sliding yoke can stop between seats in random motion-QC poses, so the
  cone's clearance is derived from the groove rather than from a single seat diameter.

## Rejected decompositions

- Independent "clamp bar profile" slot beyond seat count: the two bars differ only in seat
  count (multiplicity) and the presence of the end screw (captured by end_clamp), so a
  separate profile slot would be material-only. Rejected.
- Treating cone advance as a mimic of the feed screw: cross-domain revolute→prismatic mimic
  is unsupported; both sources keep a separate constrained scalar prismatic. Kept as source.
