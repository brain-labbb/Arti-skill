Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/arti-template/data/records`.
Category identity: a writing desk whose only articulation is a set of pull-out drawers under a
worktop. There is no door of any kind: a swinging or sliding leaf puts the object in a sibling
subcategory, and a bare table with no drawer is out of scope.

## Rejected

- doors, hutches and roll fronts: excluded by the subcategory contract (`no_door`).
- pull styles beyond the three accepted front families: derived detail, not independent slots.

## Multiplicity

- `drawer_count = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6`, applied to `drawer_front`.
  N=2 `rec_picturex0611_desk_with_drawers_fork_shallow_apron_n2_20260714/rev_000001`
  model.py:L56-L355 (shallow apron pair);
  N=3 origin 005 (single pedestal stack, model.py:L137-L319);
  N=8-class evidence from `rec_picturex0611_desk_with_drawers_fork_twin_pedestal_n8_20260714/rev_000001`
  model.py:L37-L154, whose loop distributes the trays over both pedestals; the template caps N at 6
  so every tray keeps a real front height on the smallest desk.
  Tray width, front height, box depth and travel derive from the host pedestal or apron and from N.

## Parameters and derivations

- `desk_width_m`, `desk_depth_m`, `desk_height_m` are candidate-local to `desk_form`;
  the L-shaped form derives its return wing from the same worktop thickness and leg family.
- The drawer zone is derived per form: one pedestal, two pedestals, a shallow apron band, or the
  main run of the L, and N is distributed over the available pedestals.

## Category identity and motion

- Exactly one `desk` carcass part carrying the worktop, the legs or pedestals and the runner rails.
- N moving `drawer` parts, each a hollow tray on its own prismatic slide along -Y.
- No revolute joint and no door leaf exists in any combination.
