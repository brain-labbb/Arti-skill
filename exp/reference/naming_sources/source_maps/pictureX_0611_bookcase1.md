Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`.

Category identity: a tall household bookcase or display case — vertical side boards, a stack of
horizontal shelves, a back, and a lower cabinet band that carries the moving hardware (raised-panel
or glazed doors, base drawers, or a top-pivot glazed flap). It is not a wardrobe, a sideboard, a
desk, or an empty abstract frame. Neighbouring categories: `pictureX_0611_bookcase` owns the
glazed display-cabinet family, `pictureX_0611_bookcase2` the two-tier / sliding-door / caster
family, and `pictureX_0611_Bookshelf_with_books` the shelf-with-contents family.

`core_domain = 7 (case_frame) x 5 (lower_front) x 2 (shelf_mechanism) x 3 (base_style) = 210`;
`raw_domain = 210 x 4 (shelf_count) = 840`.

Host adaptation instead of gates: every `case_frame` exports the same lower-band aperture (front
plane, aperture half-width and centre, and the band's z range) plus its own shelf rows; the
`lower_front` candidates consume only that aperture. The raked ladder exports its vertical base
box, the corner wing its front-facing wing, the cube grid and cubby columns their widest cell, and
the barrister stack its lowest section, so all 210 combinations build without a compatibility gate.

## Multiplicity and N derivation

- `shelf_count = 2 | 3 | 5 | 7`, applied to `shelf_mechanism`.
  - `observed_N = 2, 5` (shelves_n2 / shelves_n5), with n3/n5 cubby-column and n3/n6 drawer forks
    as host-capacity evidence.
  - `derived_N_range = 2..7`: the shelf loop is index-general; the bound comes from the interior
    clear height a bay still needs and from the compile/pose budget, not from the source integers.
  - validation: each N adds one shelf board (or one shelf part plus one prismatic joint) and
    re-derives shelf pitch, the lower band, the door/drawer heights and the adjustable travel.

## Independent parameters (honest, not core/raw)

- `width_m` (0.60–1.45 m) — case width; derives side spacing, shelf span, aperture half-width and
  leaf/drawer width.
- `depth_m` (0.24–0.52 m) — case depth; derives shelf depth, drawer travel, runner length.
- `height_m` (1.10–2.20 m) — case height; derives shelf pitch and the lower band.
- `shelf_thickness_m` (0.016–0.030 m) — board thickness; derives clear pitch and shelf travel.

## Rejected

- Wardrobe / sideboard / desk forks: they drop the tall shelf stack and leave the category.
- Palette, grain and knob-shape only variants: surface-only, no structural candidate.
