Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`.

Category identity: a free-standing bookcase built as an open bay frame or panel carcass, whose
front band carries the moving hardware — hinged doors, **bypass sliding doors**, drawers or a
pull-out shelf tray — and which may stand on casters. Neighbouring categories:
`pictureX_0611_bookcase` owns the glazed display-cabinet family, `pictureX_0611_bookcase1` the
tall gallery/panelled household case, and `pictureX_0611_Bookshelf_with_books` the
shelf-with-contents family.

`core_domain = 6 (case_frame) x 6 (lower_front) x 2 (shelf_mechanism) x 3 (base_style) = 216`;
`raw_domain = 216 x 4 (shelf_count) = 864`.

Host adaptation instead of gates: every `case_frame` exports the same aperture interface (front
plane, aperture half-width and centre, an upper and a lower band in z) and its own shelf rows;
`lower_front` consumes only that aperture. The bypass sliding doors additionally consume a track
pair derived from the aperture width, and the pull-out tray a runner pair derived from the case
depth, so all 216 combinations build without a compatibility gate.

## Multiplicity and N derivation

- `shelf_count = 2 | 4 | 5 | 7`, applied to `shelf_mechanism`.
  - `observed_N = 4, 5` (shelves_n4 / shelves_n5) with 4-bay and 6-drawer host-capacity forks.
  - `derived_N_range = 2..7`: the shelf loop is index-general; the bound comes from the clear bay
    height and the compile/pose budget, not from the source integers.
  - validation: every N adds one shelf board (or one shelf part plus one prismatic joint) and
    re-derives shelf pitch, the front bands, the door/drawer heights and the shelf travel.

## Independent parameters (honest, not core/raw)

- `width_m` (0.60–1.50 m), `depth_m` (0.24–0.52 m), `height_m` (1.05–2.10 m),
  `shelf_thickness_m` (0.016–0.030 m).

## Rejected

- Wardrobe / sideboard forks: they drop the shelf stack and leave the category.
- Palette and hardware-finish only variants: surface-only, no structural candidate.
