# Studio lamp — SourceMap

export_category: studio_lamp

The authoritative source pool is `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`.
The three originals and eleven authored variants are all retained as quality evidence. This map
records semantic candidates, exact source spans, interface decisions, and multiplicity behavior;
it is not a runtime dependency closure and copies no source implementation.

## Accepted multiplicities

| Multiplicity | Values | Repeated item | Host derivation | Evidence and semantics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| radial_support_count | N=3–7 | radial support module | Angular pitch is `2π/N`; hub/rim attachment widths, wheel/fork spacing, brace anchors, disk ribs and ground pads are derived from N. | Original and support variants establish radial support construction. Every support family emits N load-bearing or stabilizing modules: legs/arms for tripod and rolling families; integral cast ribs with underside ground pads for the weighted disk. N is never a metadata-only value. |
| mast_stage_count | N=1–3 | nested mast stage | Tube radius decreases per stage; collar radius, insertion overlap, exposed length, travel limits and top-interface height derive cumulatively from N. | One-stage and three-stage variants at model.py:L315-L338 and model.py:L218-L328 establish true nested-stage behavior. Every mast profile generates N actual progressively smaller tubes. |

## Rejected independent axes

- `palette_style` is removed. Source finishes belong to structural/head families: powder-black and
  graphite fabric for softboxes, dark anodized metal for LED/boom hardware, satin aluminum and
  bright collars for vintage fixtures, and cast iron/rubber for disk bases. A global recoloring
  axis would erase source identity and is not a structural slot.
- `head_module` is not independent. Barn-door brackets and focus barrels alter the host head's
  front/rear interface and articulation graph, so they are absorbed into
  `portrait_softbox_barn_doors` and `landscape_softbox_focus_ring`.
- `column_length_scale`, `mast_travel_scale`, and `head_scale` remain bounded continuous
  proportions only. Ground-support dimensions are candidate-local, direct metre-valued parameters:
  each tripod/spider has its own leg reach, `rolling_caster_star` has
  `rolling_caster_arm_length_m`, and `weighted_disk` has `weighted_disk_radius_m` in 0.20–0.50 m.
  Ribs and pads follow the weighted-disk footprint. None of these continuous values contributes to
  the discrete domain.

## Locked domain, interfaces, and derivation graph

- Component domain: `ground_support` (6) × `mast_profile` (3) ×
  `head_support_mechanism` (4) × `lamp_head_assembly` (8) = **576 core combinations**.
- Global multiplicities: `radial_support_count` (5) × `mast_stage_count` (3), giving
  **8640 raw combinations**. The full Cartesian domain must build; there is no compatibility gate
  or silent downgrade.
- Each ground support provides a centered vertical mast socket. Each mast consumes that socket,
  derives all nested stages, and provides a centered top receiver. Each support mechanism consumes
  the top receiver and provides a head-tilt axis. Every head exposes a source-envelope descriptor
  and consumes that tilt axis.
- Head envelope drives yoke/fork inside width, cheek height, pin length, boom-tip clearance and
  sweep radius. Mechanism family never forces a universal rectangular frame around every head.
- The dual-axis mechanism adds a captured vertical pan axis; the boom adds a captured horizontal
  boom axis. All pan, boom, head-tilt, leg-hinge, caster, barn-door and focus-ring revolutes are
  created through `AxisInterface`, `mate_axes`, and registered interface mates.
- `radial_support_count` drives real indexed geometry for every base family. For `weighted_disk`, N
  controls integral top ribs and matching underside rubber contact pads while preserving the source
  disk silhouette; it does not add fictitious legs. Disk radius is independently continuous from
  0.20 m to 0.50 m and does not alter core/raw diversity accounting.
- `mast_stage_count` drives stage topology, not a visual stripe: each stage is a separate nested tube
  with decreasing radius, a captured collar and a prismatic extension joint where applicable.
- Materials are selected by source family and semantic role. The DAG derives all dependent radii,
  clearances, offsets, joint limits, host capacities and total height before geometry is emitted.
