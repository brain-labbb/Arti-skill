Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`.
Category identity: a cabinet or sideboard that combines BOTH an openable door and a stack of
pull-out drawers on one load-bearing carcass. The co-existence of the two mechanisms is the
defining trait: a doors-only cabinet or a drawers-only chest is out of scope.

## Rejected

- open cubby / mirror shelf zones: recorded in 001 and 002 as fixed carcass geometry, derived here
  from the layout rather than declared as an independent slot.
- drawers-only or doors-only variants: excluded by the subcategory contract.

## Multiplicity

- `drawer_count = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4`, applied to `drawer_front`.
  N=1 origin 003 (single full-width drawer, model.py:L97-L112);
  N=2 `rec_cabinet_with_doors_and_drawers_var_drawers_n2/rev_000001` model.py:L118-L201;
  N=3 origin 004 (stacked column, model.py:L116-L199);
  N=4 origin 001 (four-drawer bank, model.py:L67-L351).
  Every drawer is an independent hollow tray on its own prismatic slide with its own runner pair.
  The drawer zone height, level pitch, tray width, box depth and travel derive from N and from the
  layout candidate.
- Door count is not an independent multiplicity: it is derived from the layout
  (one broad leaf beside the drawers, one leaf per flank, or a pair across the door zone).

## Parameters and derivations

- `carcass_width_m`, `carcass_depth_m`, `carcass_height_m` are candidate-local to `body_form`.
- `door_zone_ratio` splits the case between the door zone and the drawer zone; the mid rail,
  the hinge stiles and the drawer ladder all derive from it.
- Door leaf curvature and drawer front curvature are cross-slot derivations from the host plan
  profile, so a bow-front case gets arced doors and drawer fronts.

## Category identity and motion

- Exactly one `carcass` part carrying the case shell, the support base, the mid rail, the divider
  and the runner rails.
- At least one `door_leaf` part (revolute about a vertical hinge, or prismatic on a track) AND at
  least one `drawer` part (prismatic along -Y): both mechanisms are always present.
- Drawers are hollow trays; door leaves are overlay leaves clear of the carcass face.
