# Folding table 2 (caster / drop-leaf compact folding table) — SourceMap

export_category: pictureX_0611_Folding_table2

Authoritative records live under `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/arti-template/data/records`.

Category identity: a compact folding table whose top carries a real moving leaf — a bi-fold half,
a drop leaf, a butterfly centre leaf or a latched tilting section — over folding supports that may
stand on casters. Neighbouring categories: `pictureX_0611_Folding_table` owns the general
bi-fold/trestle family and `pictureX_0611_Folding_table1` the tube-frame rolltop family.

`core_domain = 4 (top_style) x 3 (support_style) x 3 (foot_style) = 36`;
`raw_domain = 36 x 3 (leg_count) = 108`.

Host adaptation instead of gates: every `top_style` exports the same under-top interface and one
leaf hinge line; `support_style` consumes only the under-top interface and reports its foot
positions to `foot_style`, so all 36 combinations build without a compatibility gate.

## Multiplicity and N derivation

- `leg_count = 2 | 4 | 6`, applied to `support_style`; `derived_N_range = 2..6` from the top
  length a station still needs and the pose budget. Each N re-derives the station pitch, the fold
  limit, the trestle reach and the foot spacing.

## Independent parameters (honest, not core/raw)

- `top_length_m` (0.60–1.85 m), `top_depth_m` (0.42–0.86 m), `top_height_m` (0.32–0.78 m),
  `top_thickness_m` (0.018–0.040 m).

## Rejected

- Rolltop slat decks and telescoping tube legs: they belong to `pictureX_0611_Folding_table1`.
- A-frame trestles and beam frames: they belong to `pictureX_0611_Folding_table`.
