# Microphone boom arm — SourceMap

export_category: microphone_boom_arm

The authoritative source pool is `/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`.
This map is semantic evidence only: it records exact `record/revision/model.py` spans and
does not copy source code or define a runtime closure.

## Reviewed but not independent slots

These six variant records are retained in the source audit, but are intentionally rejected as
independent domain axes. Their compensation mechanisms are absorbed into the six structural
families, and their segment graphs are not homogeneous multiplicity.

| Slot | Candidate | Diversity axis | Source type | Record/Revision | Exact model.py:Lx-Ly | Status | Key parts/joints/helpers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| compensation | cable_counterweight | ② mechanism-coupled evidence | rejected independent compensation | rec_0611_microphone_boom_arm_var_compensation_cable_counterweight/rev_000001 | model.py:L27-L142; model.py:L153-L520; model.py:L523-L765 | rejected — coupled into three_link_counterweight | Routed cable, counterweight eye and suspended weight are topology-dependent. |

| compensation | internal_gas_spring | ② mechanism-coupled evidence | rejected independent compensation | rec_0611_microphone_boom_arm_var_compensation_internal_gas_spring/rev_000001 | model.py:L29-L152; model.py:L167-L544 | rejected — coupled into tubular_gas | Gas body and rod are captured by the tubular member spacing. |
| compensation | torsion_spring_hinge | ② mechanism-coupled evidence | rejected independent compensation | rec_0611_microphone_boom_arm_var_compensation_torsion_spring_hinge/rev_000001 | model.py:L28-L164; model.py:L178-L553 | rejected — coupled into wall_swing_torsion | Torsion coil anchors and cheek depth belong to the wall-swing hinge. |

## Locked domain and interfaces

- The runtime has exactly three independent slots: `mechanism_family` (6), `base_mount` (5),
  and `terminal_mount` (3). Therefore `core_domain = raw_domain = 6 × 5 × 3 = 90`.
- There is no `multiplicity`, no `segment_count`, no independent compensation slot, and no
  compatibility gate. Each mechanism candidate carries its matched compensation system.
- Every base provides one vertical swivel `AxisInterface`; each family consumes it and provides
  one wrist pitch `AxisInterface`; each terminal consumes that wrist axis.
- Base support surfaces are planar host interfaces with candidate-specific real extents in the
  TemplateDesign; they are not sampled as a fourth slot.
- Palette and bounded continuous scale parameters change proportion or finish only and do not
  contribute to core/raw structural diversity.
