# Manual grain mill 1 — SourceMap

export_category: manual_grain_mill1

Authoritative records live under
`/mnt/zsn/lyb/arti-skill/articraft_data/data/records`. This category is the
source-image stone rotary quern: a horizontal lower quern and upper runner carried
by exposed timberwork, with a vertical grinding axis and a detailed side crank.
The directed variants alter local components while preserving that identity, so
the template decomposes them into independent component slots rather than a
single whole-machine family.

## Multiplicity

- `rim_segment_count = 10 | 14 | 18`, applied to `rim_profile`.
- The explicit N source is
  `rec_0611_manual_grain_mill_var_rim_count_10/rev_000001`
  (`model.py:L20-L41; model.py:L127-L250`). Its variant intent marks the
  change as N multiplicity and records the source `range(14)` behavior.
- Every N emits exactly N indexed `rim_profile__<candidate>__segment_<index>`
  visuals. Segment angular width and centers derive from N over the usable arc;
  the rear discharge opening remains deterministic rather than being filled by
  a denser count.

## Parameters and derivations

- `quern_radius_m = 0.28–0.34 m` drives the lower stone, grinding bed, rim
  radii, timber footprint and discharge width.
- `runner_radius_ratio = 0.62–0.70 ratio` drives runner radius, feed profile,
  radial rim clearance and crank socket location.
- `support_height_scale = 0.90–1.10 ratio` scales each selected support
  candidate around its own source-like nominal height; the grinding surface,
  bearings, discharge and all timber contacts are re-derived.
- `crank_reach_ratio = 1.55–1.85 ratio` drives arm reach, pin location and
  opposed counterweight radius while maintaining clearance above the catch rim.
- The lower quern has a real central bore. A smaller fixed metal pivot and an
  annular bearing seat are derived from that bore; the runner eye remains
  larger than the bearing envelope.

## Interfaces and bindings

- `support_frame.grinding_axis` provides the vertical axis at the derived
  grinding-bed height; `runner_profile.rotation_axis` consumes it.
- `runner_profile.grip_axis` provides the vertical crank-pin axis;
  `drive.grip_axis` consumes it.
- Both continuous joints are solved with `AxisInterface`/`mate_axes` and
  registered. The actual hierarchy remains source-like
  `support frame -> runner -> crank grip`.
- Rim inner radius derives from runner radius plus radial running clearance.
  Support footprint derives from lower-quern radius, and discharge placement
  derives from the lower-stone outlet and selected support height.

## Category identity

- Exactly one exposed timber `support_frame`, one stone `runner_stone` and one
  wooden `crank_grip` part are present.
- The runner is coaxial with and seated over the lower quern; it has a true feed
  opening and remains radially inside the interrupted catch rim.
- The lower quern retains the connected rear outlet path. All support families
  visibly carry the stone rather than surrounding it with a cabinet or frame.
- The crank retains its arm, socket, washer, pin and tapered bored grip. The
  counterweighted candidate adds structure without deleting those details.

## Rejected decompositions

- The records are not accepted as nine complete-machine candidates. Their
  unchanged quern, runner, stand and crank sections are shared source context.
- Records descending from the separate `manual_grain_mill2` source image are
  excluded; its vertical wheel/burr housing is a different category.
- A closed rectangular machine body, unsupported floating stones, a shaft
  outside the central eye, solid fake holes, and overlap/isolated-part
  allowances are rejected.
