# PictureX 0611 Air Blower To Bookcase Workflow Status - 2026-07-12

## Workflow Verdict

Variant-pool hard gate confirmed by the user on 2026-07-12.

The earlier audit found the on-disk source maps machine-converged but still
waiting for human variant inspection. The user then confirmed this exact
Air_blower-to-bookcase variant pool on 2026-07-12, so downstream high-quality
sample sync, formal spec authoring, template implementation, sweep pass, and
preview inspection may proceed in order.

Existing downstream specs, templates, records, and sweep outputs for these
categories must still be re-verified after the gate confirmation before being
counted as completed workflow delivery.

## Gate Evidence

Current source-map status:

| category | source-map gate status |
| --- | --- |
| `Air_blower` | `status: converged - GATE P1 machine-pass; awaiting human variant inspection` |
| `ball_transfer_unit_with_spring_loaded_ball` | `status: converged - GATE P1 machine-pass; awaiting human variant inspection` |
| `ball_valve_with_quarter_turn_handle` | `status: converged - GATE P1 machine-pass; awaiting human variant inspection` |
| `bevel_gear_pair_with_perpendicular_shafts` | `status: converged - GATE P1 machine-pass; awaiting human variant inspection` |
| `bi_fold_closet_door_system` | `status: converged - GATE P1 machine-pass; awaiting human variant inspection` |
| `bookcase` | `status: converged - GATE P1 machine-pass; awaiting human variant inspection` |

The historical downstream sample-sync report (available in Git history) was
for a different requested set:

- `Ice_crream_machine`
- `industrial_crane_featuring_advanced_hydraulic`
- `Industrial_rolling_work_table`
- `ironing_board2`
- `juicer_press_with_handle`
- `kitchen_cabinet`

It is not evidence for the current Air_blower-to-bookcase set.

## Provisional Downstream Artifacts Observed

Templates already exist:

- `agent/templates/pictureX_0611_Air_blower.py`
- `agent/templates/pictureX_0611_ball_transfer_unit_with_spring_loaded_ball.py`
- `agent/templates/pictureX_0611_ball_valve_with_quarter_turn_handle.py`
- `agent/templates/pictureX_0611_bevel_gear_pair_with_perpendicular_shafts.py`
- `agent/templates/pictureX_0611_bi_fold_closet_door_system.py`
- `agent/templates/pictureX_0611_bookcase.py`

Modular specs already exist:

- `articraft_template_authoring/specs_modular_v1/pictureX_0611_Air_blower.md`
- `articraft_template_authoring/specs_modular_v1/pictureX_0611_ball_transfer_unit_with_spring_loaded_ball.md`
- `articraft_template_authoring/specs_modular_v1/pictureX_0611_ball_valve_with_quarter_turn_handle.md`
- `articraft_template_authoring/specs_modular_v1/pictureX_0611_bevel_gear_pair_with_perpendicular_shafts.md`
- `articraft_template_authoring/specs_modular_v1/pictureX_0611_bi_fold_closet_door_system.md`
- `articraft_template_authoring/specs_modular_v1/pictureX_0611_bookcase.md`

Downstream 5-star record traces were found during audit:

| category | downstream records found | records with `rating=5` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `air_blower` | 15 | 15 |
| `ball_transfer_unit_with_spring_loaded_ball` | 13 | 13 |
| `ball_valve_with_quarter_turn_handle` | 15 | 15 |
| `bevel_gear_pair_with_perpendicular_shafts` | 14 | 14 |
| `bi_fold_closet_door_system` | 15 | 15 |
| `bookcase` | 35 | 20 |

These traces do not satisfy the human variant-inspection gate by themselves.

## Provisional Sweep Audit

Fresh machine sweeps were run during this audit to understand the downstream
state. They do not replace the missing manual gate.

| category | latest observed machine result |
| --- | --- |
| `pictureX_0611_Air_blower` | pipeline state verdict `pass`, pass rate `0.979167`; one resource-related seed failure was within the configured corner allowance |
| `pictureX_0611_ball_transfer_unit_with_spring_loaded_ball` | pipeline state verdict `pass`, pass rate `1.0` |
| `pictureX_0611_ball_valve_with_quarter_turn_handle` | fresh report verdict `pass`, pass rate `1.0` |
| `pictureX_0611_bevel_gear_pair_with_perpendicular_shafts` | initial parallel sweep timed out on two corner seeds; rerun with single worker and longer timeout passed `48/48` |
| `pictureX_0611_bi_fold_closet_door_system` | fresh report verdict `pass`, pass rate `1.0` |
| `pictureX_0611_bookcase` | fresh report verdict `pass`, pass rate `1.0` |

## Next Allowed Action

A human reviewer must inspect and explicitly approve the variant pool for these
six categories. After that confirmation, the valid next workflow actions are:

1. verify and, if needed, redo high-quality sample sync from accepted records only;
2. reconcile spec metadata so the specs reflect the approved sample pool;
3. run template sweeps as the official post-gate validation;
4. perform preview / human visual inspection before declaring completion.
