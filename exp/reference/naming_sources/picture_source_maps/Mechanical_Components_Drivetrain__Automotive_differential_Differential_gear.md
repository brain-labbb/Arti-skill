# Variant Plan — Mechanical Components_Drivetrain / Automotive differential_Differential gear

slug `automotive_differential_differential_gear` · pattern **mixed** (single `carrier_cage` root with
independently articulated children: `ring_gear` FIXED, two `side_gear_*` CONTINUOUS, two
`spider_gear_*` CONTINUOUS, one `drive_pinion` CONTINUOUS; loop multiplicity on bolts, spider teeth,
and spider pinion count).

  · picture `picture/Mechanical Components_Drivetrain/Automotive differential_Differential gear/001.png`
  · built form: open automotive differential — cast open cage carrier, large helical spur ring gear
  bolted on (10-bolt circle), 2 opposed bevel spider pinions on a cross shaft, 2 bevel side gears
  with coaxial axle outputs + bearing journals, and a mounted bevel drive pinion in a bearing snout.

## subcategory_contract
```yaml
subcategory_contract:
  category: Mechanical Components_Drivetrain
  subcategory: Automotive differential_Differential gear
  core_identity: >
    An automotive differential gear set — a carrier that spins about the axle axis, carries a
    final-drive ring/crown gear driven by an input pinion, and splits torque to two coaxial output
    (side/axle) gears through internal differential gearing, allowing the two outputs to turn at
    different speeds.
  must_keep:
    - final-drive input: a ring/crown gear driven by a mounted input pinion (carrier_to_ring + drive_pinion)
    - a carrier that rotates about the axle centerline and houses the differential gearing
    - exactly two coaxial output side gears with axle outputs (side_gear_0/side_gear_1, CONTINUOUS about X)
    - internal differential gearing (spider/planet/helical) that lets the two outputs differ in speed
    - at least one real non-fixed joint on side gears / internal gears
  must_not_become:
    - a plain gearbox / transmission / speed reducer (no coaxial paired axle outputs)
    - a standalone spur/bevel gear pair or single gear (no carrier, no two-output split)
    - a planetary/epicyclic reduction unit used as a reducer (sun+ring+carrier reducer, not axle split)
    - a spool / solid locked axle (no differential action at all — loses independent-output identity)
  image_evidence:
    - open box-window cast carrier cage with rounded cheeks
    - bolted flange on the ring-gear side with a full bolt circle
    - polished cross shaft crossing the open center
    - opposed bevel spider pinions meshing with two large bevel side gears
    - coaxial axle stub outputs exiting both sides
  parent_evidence:
    - carrier_cage root (helper _carrier_cage_geometry): annular cheeks, 4 window bridges, axle collars,
      ring-gear flange+shoulder, input-pinion bearing snout, cross_shaft visual
    - ring_gear (SpurGear module 0.006, 46 teeth, helix 18°) FIXED via carrier_to_ring
    - side_gear_0/1 (BevelGear 18T) + axle_output + bearing_journal, CONTINUOUS carrier_to_side_* about X
    - spider_gear_0/1 (pinion_hub + 12 radial Box teeth loop), CONTINUOUS carrier_to_spider_* about Y
    - drive_pinion (BevelGear 14T) + pinion_shaft, CONTINUOUS carrier_to_pinion about Y
    - loops: 10 bolts (bolt_i + bolt_shank_i), 12 spider teeth per spider, 2 side + 2 spider gears

## Slots and Candidates
| slot | candidate | diversity_axis | source_type | evidence | key parts/joints | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| internal_mechanism | open 2-pinion bevel spider | ① / N=2 | origin_anchor | origin | spider_gear_0/1, carrier_to_spider_* | converged |
| internal_mechanism | 4-pinion bevel spider (spider cross) | ① / N=4 | forked_anchor | var_pinions4 | spider_gear_0..3 loop, carrier_to_spider_* | planned |
| internal_mechanism | clutch-pack limited-slip (LSD) | ① | forked_anchor | var_lsd_clutch | clutch_plate_* stacks on side hubs | planned |
| internal_mechanism | viscous-coupling limited-slip | ① | forked_anchor | var_lsd_viscous | viscous_drum + interleaved plate loop | planned |
| internal_mechanism | geared / Torsen helical torque-bias | ① / ③ | forked_anchor | var_torsen | helical worm side+planet gears in pockets | planned |
| internal_mechanism | selectable locking differential | ② | forked_anchor | var_locker | dog_collar PRISMATIC engage travel | planned |
| ring_gear_form | helical spur ring gear (disc) | ③ | origin_anchor | origin | ring_gear/toothed_ring | converged |
| ring_gear_form | bevel crown-wheel ring gear | ③ | forked_anchor | var_ring_bevel | ring_gear as BevelGear + repositioned drive_pinion | planned |
| carrier_form | open window cage | ① | origin_anchor | origin | carrier_cage / open_cage | converged |
| carrier_form | closed solid carrier (small ports) | ① | forked_anchor | var_carrier_closed | carrier_cage solid shell + inspection windows | planned |
| output_side_gears | two coaxial bevel side gears | core (fixed=2) | origin_anchor | origin | side_gear_0/1 | converged (invariant) |

Side-gear count is fixed at 2 by the definition of an automotive differential (two axle outputs); it is
NOT a multiplicity axis. Multiplicity lives on the spider/pinion count and on decorative loops.

## Six-Axis Diversity Audit
| axis | treatment | values / range / reason |
|---|---|---|
| ① skeleton / topology | source-backed (origin + forks) | internal_mechanism {open-2p, open-4p, clutch-LSD, viscous-LSD, geared/Torsen, locker}; carrier_form {open-cage, closed-solid} |
| ② joint / mechanism | source-backed | origin: FIXED ring, CONTINUOUS side/spider/pinion. Forks add: locker dog-collar PRISMATIC engagement; clutch/viscous plate stacks (record as static or minimal travel). |
| ③ primary form family | source-backed + world_knowledge | ring_gear_form: helical spur disc (origin) vs conical bevel crown-wheel (fork); geared-LSD helical worm gear family |
| ④ surface decoration | record_only / world_knowledge_extrapolation | cast-iron pebble texture, machined ring flank facets, blackened bolt heads, part number/cast rib decals — host-conformal, no dedicated variant |
| ⑤ proportion / size / travel | record_only | ring teeth 40–48, module ~0.006; bolt circle 8–12; spider teeth 10–14; side gear 16–20T; carrier Ø ~0.18; side/spider CONTINUOUS; locker travel ~0.01–0.02 |
| ⑥ material / palette / finish | record_only | dark_cast_iron / machined_steel / oiled_gear_steel / bright_tooth_faces / blackened_bolts; alt: nodular grey iron, phosphate-black ring, bronze worm gears (Torsen) |

①②③ and multiplicity N=4 are candidate-anchor axes and are source-backed by origin or a converged fork.
④⑤⑥ are record_only / companion only — never standalone variants and never used to reach the budget.

## Multiplicity / Copy Logic
- count_param: `n_spider` (spider/planet pinion count).
  - N samples: 2 (origin, opposed pair on a cross shaft) and 4 (fork var_pinions4, four pinions on a
    4-arm spider cross at 90°).
  - suggested N_range: [2, 4] (2 and 4 are the standard automotive counts; odd counts are not used).
  - copied object: `spider_gear_{i}` part (pinion_hub + 12-tooth loop); naming `spider_gear_{i}`,
    joints `carrier_to_spider_{i}`; placement radial about the axle axis on the spider cross; joint
    policy CONTINUOUS about each pinion's radial axis.
- Existing decorative loops (record_only, `count=`-style, not forks): flange bolts `bolt_{i}` /
  `bolt_shank_{i}` (N=10, range 8–12); spider teeth `tooth_{j}` (N=12, range 10–14); viscous plate
  stack loop for var_lsd_viscous.

---

## Budget decision
- Richness band: **simple** (target 8–12). Chosen total = **8 candidate anchors** (low end).
- Candidate anchors = 1 origin_anchor + 7 forked_anchors.
- underfilled_reason: Differential gear is a narrow, tightly-constrained mechanical subcategory. Core
  identity fixes the output count at exactly 2 side gears and mandates a carrier + ring + input pinion,
  so most vocabulary lives on the internal-mechanism family (open / clutch-LSD / viscous-LSD /
  geared-Torsen / locker), one meaningful ring-form family switch, one carrier-form switch, and one
  spider multiplicity sample. Beyond these the remaining variety is ④⑤⑥ (teeth counts, module,
  finish) which are record_only. No filler added; the 5 canonical differential families plus the 2
  structural sub-variants and the N=4 sample are the honest structural coverage.

## Blocked / Excluded
- spool / mini-spool (solid locked axle): fixes both side gears to the carrier, eliminating differential
  action — violates core_identity (independent output speeds). Blocked, out-of-category.
- odd spider counts (N=3 bevel): not used in real automotive differentials; excluded from N sweep
  (helical planet-worm triples belong to the Torsen fork, not the bevel N sweep).
- ④/⑤/⑥-only variants (teeth-count / module / finish / palette sweeps): record_only, no fork emitted.
